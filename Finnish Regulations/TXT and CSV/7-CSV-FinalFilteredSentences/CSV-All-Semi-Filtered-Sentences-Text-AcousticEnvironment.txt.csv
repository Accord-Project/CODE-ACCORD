10_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"Directive 2015/1535/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (32015L1535); OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1."
11_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,Section 3  Design and construction of the acoustic environment of a building.
12_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,The noise and vibration at the site of the building shall be taken into account in the design and construction of the building.
13_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"If it is not practicable to apply the procedure referred to in subsection 2 on account of the special characteristics of the building or the acoustic environment outside it, special use of the space or user group or some other special reason, the party initiating the building project shall in connection with the building permit procedure demonstrate that, considering the intended use of  the  space,  the  design  process  will  lead  to  the  fulfilment  of  the  essential  technical characteristics with regard to the sound insulation, noise and vibration abatement and acoustic conditions."
14_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,Section 4 Requirements for the sound insulation of a new building.
15_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"In the design and implementation of airborne sound insulation and impact sound insulation of dwellings  and  accommodation  and  patient  rooms,  the  following  numerical  values  shall  be observed."
16_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"If the dwelling or accommodation or patient room is structurally connected with spaces where intense,  particularly  annoying  or  lowfrequency  noise  is  generated,  in  the  design  and implementation process special consideration shall be given to the implementation of sufficient sound  insulation."
17_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"In  rooms  used  for  sleeping  or  rest,  the  onehour  Aweighted  equivalent continuous sound level of impulsive, narrowband or lowfrequency noise may not exceed 25 decibels."
18_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"Considering  the  intended  use  of  the  space,  the  sound  insulation  of  facilities  for  teaching, meeting, eating, treatment, recreation or physical exercise or office spaces shall be designed and implemented so that the acoustic environment achieved adequately meets the requirements for the activities carried out in the space."
19_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"The sound insulation of recessed balconies, conservatories and roof terraces shall be designed and implemented so that the acoustic environment does not cause any inconvenience to the residents."
20_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,Section 5 Requirements for noise and vibration abatement in a new building.
21_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"The  sound  insulation  of  the  envelope  of  a  building  with  dwellings  or  accommodation  or patient  rooms  shall  be  designed  and  implemented  so  that  the  sound  insulation  is  at  least  30 decibels and the A-weighted equivalent continuous sound level of impulsive, narrowband or lowfrequency noise in rooms used for sleeping or rest does not exceed 25 decibels."
22_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"The installation of lifts in a building and technical building systems shall be designed and implemented  so  that  the  noise  level  generated  by  them  in  residential  or  other  spaces  in dwellings, accommodation or patient rooms, outside openable windows or air vents of the same building or adjacent residential buildings, on balconies used by residents, or in yards or other spaces intended for use by residents does not exceed the following numerical values."
23_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"Considering the intended use of the space, the structureborne noise and vibration insulation of a building with dwellings or accommodation or patient rooms and the noise and vibration abatement of facilities for teaching, meeting, eating, treatment, recreation or physical exercise and office spaces shall be designed and implemented so that the acoustic environment achieved adequately meets the requirements for the activities carried out in the space."
24_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,Section 6 Requirements for the acoustic conditions of a new building.
25_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"The acoustic conditions of a building with patient rooms and facilities for teaching, meeting, eating,  treatment,  recreation  or  physical  exercise  and  office  spaces  shall  be  designed  and implemented so that the speech discrimination achieved in the space is adequate considering the intended use of the space."
26_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,A  building  with  dwellings  or  accommodation  or  patient  rooms  shall  be  designed  and implemented so that the reverberation time of the staircase and exit route is no more than 1.3 seconds.
27_Finnish_AcousticEnvironment,"Yards and spaces intended for use by residents of a building and balconies used by residents  shall  be  designed  and  implemented  so  that  the  Aweighted  equivalent  continuous sound level between 7.00 and 22.00 does not exceed 55 decibels and, similarly, conservatories so that the Aweighted equivalent continuous sound level does not exceed 45 decibels."
