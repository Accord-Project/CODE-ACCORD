167_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,The heating capacity of a buildings heating system shall be designed so that the designed temperature conditions and ventilation of the spaces can be maintained at the design outdoor temperatures of the climatic zone in accordance with the location of the building presented in Annex 1.
168_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,"In design, opportunities to reduce the need for peak power and to improve the controllability of electric power consumption shall be taken into account."
169_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,"A  building  of  intended  use  category  1  or  2  meets  the  requirements  set  for  energy performance if: 1)  the  buildings  heat  loss  is  at  most  equal  to  the  reference  heat  loss  determined  for  the building  on  the  basis  of  the  structural  energy  efficiency  reference  values  calculated correspondingly to what is set out in sections 24, 25 and 26."
170_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,"The reference values for building element  thermal  transmittance  coefficients,  air  leakage  rate  and  annual  efficiency  of ventilation extract air heat recovery are."
171_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,Section 34 Energy declarations.
172_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,An energy declaration shall be drawn up when designing a building.
173_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,The energy declaration shall be updated before the commissioning of the building if changes have taken place in designs used as a basis for the permitstage energy declaration.
174_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,The person responsible  for  the  construction  stage  shall  make  an  entry  in  the  building  inspection documents concerning compliance of construction work with the information presented in the energy declaration.
175_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,Chapter 5 Transitional provisions and entry into force.
176_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,Section 35 Entry into force.
177_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,This Decree enters into force on 1 January 2018.
178_Finnish_EnergyEfficiency,"Upon the entry into force of this Decree, pending projects shall be subject to the rules valid at the time of entry into force of this Decree."
