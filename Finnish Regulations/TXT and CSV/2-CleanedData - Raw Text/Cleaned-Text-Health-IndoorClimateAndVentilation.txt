Indoor climate of buildings 

Section 3 

Design of indoor climate  

When  designing  a  building,  a  principal  designer,  special  designer  and  building  designer 

shall,  in  accordance  with  their  respective  duties,  take  into  account  the  following  factors 

affecting the indoor climate of the building: 

1)  internal  load  factors,  such  as:  thermal  and  moisture  loads,  equipment,  lighting,  human 

loads, noise sources, processes, construction product emissions and other impurities related to 

the buildings use; 

2)  external  load  factors,  such  as:  weather  and  acoustic  conditions,  outdoor  air  quality  and 

other environmental factors; 

3) the location of the building and the building site. 

A principal designer, special designer and building designer shall, in accordance with their 

respective duties, take into account the indoor climate in line with the buildings intended use 

when:  

1)  designing  the  buildings  thermal  insulation  and  vapour  barriers  and  the  properties  and 

solar protection of windows; 

2) designing the buildings energy performance; 

3)  determining  the  airtightness  of  a  building  envelope,  base  floor  and  shafts  and  the 

airtightness of structures between spaces; 

4) designing a buildings soundproofing and noise control; 

5) designing the lighting of spaces and utilisation of daylight; 

6) selecting construction materials; 

7)  designing  a  buildings  heating  and  cooling  as  well  as  other  building  services  systems, 

their reliability in operation and space requirements; 

8) planning moisture control at the building site; 

9) designing the control of cleanliness of the building work and the ventilation system; 

10) drawing up the timetables for the building site, acceptance and commissioning; 

11)  designing  the  usability,  appropriate  use  and  maintenance  of  a  building  and  technical 

systems and drawing up usage and maintenance instructions for the building. 

In order to create an indoor climate which is in accordance with the buildings intended use, 

structural  means  may  be  used,  internal  load  factors  reduced,  the  impact  of  external  and 

internal load factors limited, and heating, cooling, ventilation and air conditioning technology 

means and related control and regulation employed. 

Section 4  

Design values for room temperature 

During the design period of occupancy, a buildings room temperature shall be comfortable 

and  not  adversely  affected  by  air  velocity,  thermal  radiation,  temperature  fluctuation, 

temperature differences or surface temperatures. 

A temperature of 21 C shall be used as the design value for room temperature during the 

heating  season.  In  designs  for  room  temperature  control,  room  temperature  may  fluctuate 

between 20 C and 25 C during the heating season and between 20 C and 27 C outside the 

heating  season.  For  a  special  reason,  such  as  an  activity  in  a  space  requiring  specific 

temperatures or the special nature of a space, temperatures deviating from these values may be 

used as design values for room temperature and in designs for room temperature control. 

The design weather data used as a basis for room temperature control design shall be the test 

reference year weather data provided for the various climatic zones and the design outdoor air 

temperatures  for  the  heating  season  provided  for  the  various  climatic  zones  presented  in 

Annex 1. 

Section 5 

Indoor air quality 

Particulate  impurities  or  physical,  chemical  or  microbiological  factors  in  quantities  which 

could endanger health or odours continuously adversely affecting comfort shall not be present 

in indoor air.  

The design value for the instantaneous concentration of carbon dioxide in indoor air during 

the design occupancy period of a room shall be at most 1,450 mg/m3 (800 ppm) greater than 

the concentration in outdoor air. 

Section 6 

Indoor air humidity 

Indoor  air  humidity  shall  remain  within  values  that  are  in  accordance  with  the  designed 

intended  use  of  the  spaces,  so  as  to  avoid  moisture  damage,  microbial  growth  or  health 

hazards caused by indoor air humidity.  

Section 7 

Lighting conditions 

In a buildings indoor spaces, it shall be possible to maintain the lighting required for visual 

tasks during the design occupancy period of the spaces.  

The grouping and control of lighting shall be designed so that lighting can be controlled in 

accordance with activities.  

Chapter 3  

Ventilation and ventilation systems 

Section 8 

Ventilation 

Ventilation  shall  provide  healthy,  safe  and  comfortable  indoor  air  quality  in  occupiable 

spaces. The ventilation system shall produce an adequate outdoor air flow to the building and 

extract from indoor air substances that are harmful to health, excessive humidity, odours with 

adverse  effects  on  comfort  and  indoor  air  impurities  arising  from  humans,  construction 

products and activities.  

The ventilation system shall be designed so that: 

1)  the  functions  central  to  the  functioning  of  the  selected  ventilation  system  can  be 

measured, controlled and monitored; 

2)  when  correctly  used,  serviced and  maintained,  the  system  will remain  in  good  working 

order for its design life;  

3) the functioning of the system can be brought to a complete stop. In a mechanical system, 

there  shall  be  a  clearly  labelled  stop  switch,  which  shall  be  located  in  an  easily  accessible 

place. In a natural ventilation system, the ventilation valves shall be easy to close. 

Section 9 

Outdoor air flows 

A special designer shall design the ventilation system so that an outdoor air flow required 

for healthy, safe and comfortable indoor air quality can be delivered to the occupiable spaces. 

The outdoor air flow to the occupiable spaces shall be designed to be a minimum of 6 dm3/s 

per person during the design occupancy period where there is no need for additional air flow 

arising  from  the  intended  use  of  the  space.  The  outdoor  air  flow  of  the  entire  building, 

however, shall be designed to be a minimum of 0.35 (dm3/s)/m2 of floor surface area during 

the design  occupancy  period  where there is  no  need for additional air  flow arising  from  the 

special  nature  of  the  intended  use  of  a  space  in  the  building.  The  outdoor  air  flow  of  a 

dwelling unit, however, shall be designed to be a minimum of 18 dm3/s. 

Section 10 

Control of air flows  

It shall be possible to control air flows in accordance with load or air quality according to 

the occupancy situation. 

The  control  of  air  flows  in  a  dwelling  unit  shall  be  designed in  a  manner  whereby  supply 

and extract air flows can be controlled either at building or dwelling unit level so that they can 

be  increased  to  a  level  at  least  30  above  the  air  flows  of  the  design  occupancy  period.  If 

ventilation can be controlled at dwelling unit level, the dwelling units supply and extract air 

flows  may  be  reduced  by  no  more  than  60  from  the  air  flows  of  the  design  occupancy 

period.  

The outdoor air flow for a building other than a residential building shall be a minimum of 

0.15 (dm/s)/m of floor surface area outside the design occupancy period and the air shall be 

exchanged in all rooms.  

This section does not apply to such an extension of a building or increase of gross floor area 

where  the  existing  ventilation  system  can  be  used  to  provide  ventilation  and  the  quality  of 

indoor air in the building is not impaired. 

Section 11 

Air flows in parking garages for motor vehicles  

A  special  designer  shall  design  the  ventilation  air  flows  of  a  parking  garage  for  motor 

vehicles  so  that  air  impurities  do  not  cause  health  hazards  for  users.  The  air  flows  shall  be 

designed  so  that  the  average  carbon  monoxide  concentration  in  a  parking  garage  for  motor 

vehicles  during  the  hour  of  use  assessed  as  the  most  critical  does  not  exceed  35  mg/m3  (30 

ppm). Air flows in the continuous working area of a parking garage for motor vehicles shall 

be  designed  so  that  the  instantaneous  carbon  monoxide  concentration  does  not  exceed 

7 mg/m3 (6 ppm).  

Section 12 

Air filtration 

A  special  designer  shall  design  the  level  of  air  filtration  on  the  basis  of  the  outdoor  air 

quality and the objectives set for indoor air quality. When selecting a ventilation system, the 

special  designer  shall  take  into  account  the  systems  suitability  for  the  required  level  of 

filtration. 

Section 13 

Extract air categories  

Extract air categories are as follows: 

Category  1:  extract  air  with  only  a  low  level  of  impurities  and  with  the  main  sources  of 

impurities being humans and structures;  

Category 2: extract air with a moderate level of impurities; 

Category  3:  extract  air  with  impurities,  humidity,  chemicals  or  odours  which  substantially 

reduce the quality of the extract air;  

Category  4:  extract  air  with  a  significant  level  of  malodorous  or  unhealthy  impurities  or 

chemicals.  

Section 14 

Installation location of externally mounted air transfer devices and exhaust air devices  

Outdoor air shall not be introduced via a structure or a structural component which impairs 

air quality or from the vicinity of sources of outdoor air pollutants.  

Snow  or  rainwater  shall  not  be  allowed  to  ingress  the  ventilation  system  via  externally 

mounted air transfer devices in quantities causing damage to the system, lowering air quality 

or impairing the functioning of the system. 

The conducting of exhaust air out of a building shall be designed so that no health or other 

hazards  are  caused  to  the  building  or  to  other  buildings,  the  environment  or  their  users. 

Exhaust air shall be conducted to above the buildings roof, unless otherwise required by the 

functioning  of  the  ventilation  system.  Extract  air  of  category  1  or  dwelling  unit  ventilation 

exhaust air may also be conducted to the outdoors via an exhaust air device mounted on the 

wall of the building (wall exhaust), provided that the requirements laid down otherwise in this 

subsection are met.  

Section 15 

Recirculation, transfer and secondary air  

A special designer shall design the ventilation of a building so that only air from spaces with 

equivalent or higher air purity can be used as recirculation or transfer air and this air shall not 

contain  quantities  of  impurities  that  impair  air  quality.  The  use  of  recirculation,  transfer  or 

secondary air shall not cause any harmful spread of impurities, in particular odours.  

Extract air of categories 2, 3 and 4 shall not be used as recirculation air. 

Recirculation air shall not be used as supply air in the following spaces: 

1) dwelling units; 

2) professional kitchens; 

3)  accommodation  sections  of  accommodation  and  catering  establishments  and  boarding 

schools; 

4)  teaching  spaces  of  educational  institutions  and  rest,  play  and  group  rooms  of  daycare 

centres;  

5)  accommodation  sections  of  medical  care,  welfare  and  penal 

institutions  and 

corresponding facilities; 

6) restaurants and cafs;  

7)  other  spaces  to  be  kept  particularly  clean,  unless  the  recirculation  air  is  purified  to  the 

level required by the intended use of the space. 

Section 16 

Spreading of impurities in heat recovery units 

If a ventilation system is equipped with heat recovery, a special designer shall design heat 

recovery so as to avoid the spreading of impurities or odours causing adverse effects to health 

or comfort via the process. When heat is recovered from extract air of category 4, there shall 

be no leaks between supply and extract air. When heat is recovered from extract air of other 

extract air categories, the direction of the leakage air flow shall be primarily from the supply 

air side towards the extract air side.  

In heat recovery of a ventilation system that serves a single space or a single dwelling unit, 

the direction of leakage air flow may, in all extract air categories, also be from the extract air 

side towards the supply air side if the supply air is sufficient to guarantee compliance with the 

requirements set for indoor air quality in section 5 and for indoor air humidity in section 6 and 

the volume of outdoor air flow fulfils the requirements in accordance with section 9. 

Section 17 

Distribution and extraction of air 

The distribution and extraction of air in a building shall be such that air flows to the entire 

occupied zone while avoiding air velocity causing discomfort, with the exception of any need 

for enhanced ventilation, and that impurities generated in a room are efficiently extracted. The 

air in a building shall flow from spaces of higher indoor air purity to spaces of lower indoor 

air purity.  

Section 18 

Combining ventilation 

Combining of ventilation ducts must not give rise to a risk of impurities spreading or impair 

the functioning of the ventilation system.  

Ventilation ducts may be combined on the basis of extract air categories as follows: 

1)  extract  air  of  categories  1  and  2  may  be  conducted  into  common  ductwork.  If  the  air 

flows of extract air categories 1 and 2 are combined into the same duct and category 2 air flow 

accounts  for  more  than  10  of  the  combined  air  flow,  the  combined  air  flow  is  classified 

under category 2; 

2) extract air of category 3 shall be conducted through individual ducts, or common ducts 

serving spaces of the same type as regards level of air purity, to the outdoors, into a collection 

duct installed above the spaces it serves or into an extract air chamber. Extract air from toilets, 

washrooms and cleaning spaces may be conducted to vertical ducts for extract air categories 1 

and 2 if the total extract air flow from these spaces does not exceed 10 of the total air flow 

in the vertical duct. In such cases, the combined air flow shall not be used as recirculation air. 

In mechanical ventilation, extract air from all of the spaces of a single dwelling unit may be 

conducted through the same air duct directly to the outdoors, into a collection duct installed 

above the spaces it serves or into an extract air chamber.  Extract air from different dwelling 

units may be conducted to common vertical ducts of the same mechanical ventilation system 

in such a way that extract air from the kitchens is conducted to a vertical duct that serves the 

kitchens,  while  extract  air  from  other  spaces  is  conducted  to  an  individual  vertical  duct.  In 

natural  ventilation,  the  vertical  ducts  of  a  single  dwelling  may  not  be  combined,  nor  may 

common vertical ducts of more than one dwelling be used;   

3) extract air of category 4 shall be conducted to the outdoors through individual extract air 

ducts.  If  significant  quantities  of  substances  that  are  hazardous  to  health  or  that  generate  a 

strong odour are handled or stored in a space, outdoor air and extract air ducts that are separate 

from the rest of the ventilation system shall be provided for that room and the space shall be 

designed to be at negative pressure in relation to adjacent spaces.  

Any  connection  of  two  or  more  air  handling  units  to  the  same  duct  or  chamber  shall  be 

designed so that the pressures of the rooms or the directions of air flow between the rooms and 

in the ductworks do not change when the air flows of the units are being controlled. A natural 

ventilation system, a mechanical extract ventilation system or a mechanical supply and extract 

ventilation system shall not be designed to be combined in such a way that the directions of air 

flow  between  the  rooms  and  in  the  ductworks  may  change  when  the  air  flows  are  being 

controlled.  

Section 19

Section 20 

Requirements for ventilation system airtightness and strength  

The  natural  or  mechanical  ventilation  system  of  a  building  shall  be  strong  and  its 

airtightness  shall  be  at  least  class  B.  If  the  extract  air  contains  significant  amounts  of 

impurities other than of human origin, the airtightness class shall be at least C. 

In a mechanical ventilation system, the extract air ducts within the building that are located 

outside the plant room shall be designed to be at negative pressure. Extract air ducts in extract 

air categories 1 and 2 may, however, be at positive pressure within the building, provided that 

the ductwork is at least of airtightness class C. Extract air ducts in extract air category 3 and 

exhaust air ducts for individual dwelling units may be at positive pressure within the building, 

provided that the  ductwork  is  at  least  of  airtightness class  D.  Extract  air  ducts  in  extract  air 

category 4 may be at positive pressure within the building if the ductwork does not leak.    

In natural and mechanical ventilation systems, the stiffening and support of air ducts shall be 

designed so that the ducts remain firmly in place and can withstand any pressure fluctuations, 

cleaning and other stresses that may occur in the ventilation system.  

In  a  mechanical  ventilation  system,  the  air  handling  units  and  chambers  shall  be  able  to 

withstand the loads caused by fan pressure while the shutoff dampers are closed. If the cross

sectional area of a mechanical ventilation systems air duct is designed to be greater than 0.06 

m2,  the  outdoor  air  and  exhaust  air  ducts  shall  be  fitted  with  shutoff  dampers  that  close 

automatically when the system shuts down. 

Section 21 

Pressures caused by air flows and airtightness of structures 

A  special  designer  shall  design  a  buildings  outdoor  air  and  exhaust  air  flows  so  that 

structures  are  not  exposed  to  any  longterm  moisture  loads  damaging  the  structures  due  to 

positive  pressure  or  any  transfer  of  impurities  to  indoor  air  due  to  negative  pressure.  A 

principal  designer,  special  designer  and  building  designer  shall,  in  accordance  with  their 

respective duties, design the airtightness of a buildings envelope and internal structures and 

its  chimney  effect  management  so  that  the  prerequisite  conditions  for  the  functioning  of 

ventilation  can  be  secured,  the  transfer  to  indoor  air  of  impurities  from  structures,  soil 

impurities and radon is avoided and the transfer of moisture into structures is avoided.  

Section 22 

Fuelfired appliances and separate extract systems 

A special designer shall design the supply of additional outdoor air flow required by the use 

of  any  fuelfired  appliance  and  separate  extract  systems  so  that  the  buildings  ventilation 

system functions in a controlled manner and there are no detrimental changes in pressures in 

the building or rooms.  

Section 23 

Air humidification 

If the ventilation system is equipped with air humidification, a special designer shall design 

the air humidification so as to avoid the conditions for microbial growth that is hazardous to 

health. 

Section 24 

Ventilation system cleanability and serviceability 

A  special  designer  shall  design  the  ventilation  system  and  its  maintenance  and  servicing 

access  routes  so  that  the  parts  of  the  ventilation  system  can  be  easily  and  safely  cleaned, 

serviced,  repaired  and  replaced.  For  the  maintenance,  servicing  and  repair  of  air  handling 

units, space which is at least the size of the units to be maintained or serviced shall be reserved 

in the access direction.  

Section 25 

Ventilation system insulation 

A  special  designer  shall  design  the  thermal  insulation  and  vapour  barriers  of  ventilation 

ducts, chambers and air handling units so that air will not cool down or warm up in a way that 

causes  adverse  effects  on  temperature  control  or  comfort  and  so  that  there  will  not  be  any 

condensation of moisture damaging structures or reducing indoor air quality.  

Chapter 4  

Ventilation system commissioning measurements  

Section 26 

Airtightness 

The party engaging in the building project shall see to the measurement of the airtightness of 

the  ventilation  system  prior  to  the  commissioning  of  a  building.  As  regards  ventilation 

systems  serving  a  single  space  in  a  building  or  a  single  dwelling  unit,  the  airtightness 

measurement  may  be  replaced  by  an  installation  survey  if  the  ductwork  consists  entirely  of 

ducts  and  duct  components  at  least  of  airtightness  class  C.  The  person  responsible  for  the 

construction  stage  shall  make  an  entry  in  the  building  inspection  documents  concerning 

compliance of the airtightness of the ventilation system with design specifications. 

Verification of ventilation system compliance with design specifications 

Section 27 

The party engaging in the building project shall see to the measurement and adjustment of 

the air flows of the ventilation system, the determination of the systems specific fan power 

and  the  compliance  of  the  functioning  of  the  ventilation  system  with  design  specifications 

prior  to  the  commissioning  of  a  building.    The  building  and  its  ventilation  system  shall  be 

clean  before  air  flow  measurement  and  adjustment  and  before  system  commissioning.  The 

person  responsible  for  the  construction  stage  shall  make  an  entry  in  the  building  inspection 

documents concerning compliance of the ventilation system with design specifications.  

Permissible tolerances in respect of design values may be as follows: 

1) air flow at system and dwelling unit level  10; 

2) air flow at room level  20, with, however, the deviation always permitted to be at least
