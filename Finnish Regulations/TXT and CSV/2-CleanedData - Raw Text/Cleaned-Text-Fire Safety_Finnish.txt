Section 3 

Demonstration of compliance with essential technical requirements regarding fire safety 

The chief designer, building designer and specialist designer shall, in accordance with their 

respective duties, take care of the design of the building so that the building meets the essential 

technical requirements set for fire safety in accordance with its intended use.  

The essential technical requirements set for fire safety will be met if the building is designed 

and constructed in accordance with the classes and numerical criteria set out in this Decree.  

The fire safety requirements will also be met if the building is designed and constructed based 

on a design fire scenario that covers the situations that are likely to occur in the building. The 

meeting of the requirement shall be attested on a casebycase basis, taking into account the 

properties and use of the building. In a design that is based on a design fire scenario, methods 

that are of demonstrated validity must be used. The basis for the design, the models used and 

the obtained results shall be presented in connection with the building permit procedure. 

Section 4 

Fire classes of buildings 

The building fire classes are P0, P1, P2 and P3. 

Fire classes P1, P2 and P3 are to be used when the building is designed on the basis of the 

classes and numerical criteria set out in this Decree. Fire class P0 is to be used when the building 

is designed primarily or entirely using a procedure based on a design fire scenario. 

Different parts of a building may belong to different fire classes provided that the spread of 

fire from one part to another is prevented by a fire wall. 

Section 5  

Intended use of the building 

A building or its fire compartment shall be classified on the basis of its intended primary use.  

For the purposes of this Decree: 

1) dwellings refers to premises used as residences, such as residential apartments and leisure 

apartments; 

2) accommodation premises refers to premises such as hotels, holiday homes and residential 

homes that are normally in use 24 hours a day and where no one is under care or in confinement; 

3) institutions refers to premises such as hospitals, homes for the elderly, closed prisons and 

daycare centres that are in use 24 hours a day, and where people are under care or in confine

ment; 

4) assembly and business premises refers to premises such as restaurants, shops, schools, day

care centres and other early childhood education premises, sports halls, exhibition halls, thea

tres, churches, libraries and daycare institutions that are generally in daytime or evening use 

and occupied by a considerable number of members of the public or customers; 

5)  office  premises refers  to  premises  such  as  offices that are  generally  in  daytime  use  and 

where the majority of the personnel are familiar with the premises; 

6) production and storage premises refers to premises associated with industrial activity and 

storage,  such  as  ordinary  industrial  premises,  premises  for  agricultural  production  and  large 

warehouses with a generally regular personnel familiar with the local conditions; 

7) garages refers to premises intended for the keeping of cars and similar motor vehicles. 

The activities in production and storage premises are divided into two fire hazard classes:  

1) 1, activities involving a minor or moderate fire hazard;  

2) 2, activities involving a significant or major fire hazard, or where there may be an explosion 

hazard.  

An area with a potentially flammable or explosive atmosphere must not be located in a build

ing where there are dwellings, accommodation premises, institutions or assembly and business 

premises. However, necessary areas with a potentially flammable or explosive atmosphere that 

are required by the intended use of the building may be located with the abovementioned prem

ises if effective arrangements are in place to ensure that these do not jeopardise personal safety. 

Section 6 

Fire load and determination of fire load category 

The fire loads that form the basis of the design of a P0 fire class building shall be determined. 

The fire load categories of the fire compartments of a P1 fire class building shall be deter

mined. The fire load categories are as follows:  

1) less than 600 MJ/m2;  

2) at least 600 MJ/m2, but not more than 1,200 MJ/m2; 

3) over 1,200 MJ/m2. 

The fire load category shall be determined on the basis of the use of the fire compartment, or 

the fire load and the fire load category determined on the basis of this shall be determined by 

calculation. 

Section 7 

Determination of fire load category on the basis of use 

Areas of a building or of a part thereof that are reserved for various uses may be placed in fire 

load categories according to the fire load density that is determined on the basis of use. 

Areas  belonging  to  fire  load  category  less  than  600 MJ/m2  are  dwellings,  accommodation 

premises, institutions, office premises, garages and some assembly and business premises, such 

as restaurants, schools, sports halls, theatres, churches, daycare centres, daycare institutions 

and shops with a fire compartment size not exceeding 300 square metres. 

Areas belonging to fire load category at least 600 MJ/m2 but not more than 1,200 MJ/m2 are 

some assembly and business premises such as shops (fire compartment size over 300 square 

metres), exhibition halls and libraries, fire compartments of residential buildings that contain 

storage areas for personal property, storage spaces of no more than 50 square meters, and prem

ises for the repair and servicing of motor vehicles. 

Areas belonging to fire load category over 1,200 MJ/m2 are storage areas that form separate 

fire compartments and have a floor area exceeding 50 square meters. 

The fire load of production and storage premises is determined on a casebycase basis. 

Section 8 

Restrictions on the size, number of occupants and use of buildings 

The size and number of occupants of a P2 and a P3 fire class building shall, depending on the 

use  of  the  building,  be  restricted  in  order  to  guarantee  personal  safety  and  to  facilitate  fire

Limitation signs 

If the fire class of the building is P0 or if an application for a permit relates to a design that is 

based on a smaller number of occupants than the size of the building would normally permit, or 

on an exceptionally small fire load, this limitation must be stated in the building permit decision. 

A  fixed  sign  indicating  the  limitation  shall  be  placed  in  the  building  in  an  easily  noticeable 

place. 

Section 10 

Prevention of ignition 

The hazard of ignition of fire within a building must be as low as possible.  

Technical installations shall be made in such a way that the hazards of ignition of fire and 

spread of fire and smoke within the building is not essentially increased thereby. 

Fireplaces, chimneys and heating devices shall be located and built or installed in such a man

ner that their use will not create a hazard of fire or explosion. 

Chapter 2 

Maintaining the loadbearing capacity of structures 

Section 11 

Loadbearing capacity of structures in a fire situation 

A building and the building elements therein must not cause danger through collapse within 

a specified period of time after the start of a fire. If necessary for the safety of people or with 

regard to the extent of the damage, the building must sustain the combustion of the entire fire 

load and the cooling phase without collapse. 

Section 12 

Design based on classification 

The class requirements regarding the loadbearing capacity of the structures of P1 and P2 fire 

class buildings are laid down in Table 3. 

The class requirement for loadbearing structures of a basement storey below the uppermost 

basement storey of a P3 fire class building is R 60, A2s1, d0. 

If a loadbearing element is required to have a longer fire resistance time with respect to in

tegrity E and insulation I than with respect to loadbearing capacity R, the longer fire resistance 

time shall also be applied to the loadbearing capacity. 

Fulfilment of the class requirement shall be attested by testing, calculation, combining the 

results of testing and calculation, or by using an acceptable design method based on the use of 

tables. Conformity with class requirement is determined on the basis of the standard tempera

ture/time curve.

  The fire resistance time requirement for balconies is half that of the loadbearing structures of the storey. 

  Loadbearing structures must be made of building materials of at least class Ds2, d2, unless otherwise stated in the table. 

The class requirement for the flight of stairs and staircase landing of an exit is R 30. The class requirement for the flight of 

stairs and staircase landing of the exit of a basement storey below the uppermost basement storey is R 60.  If class require

ment A2s1, d0 is prescribed for loadbearing structures, this also applies to flights of stairs and staircase landings. Flights of 

stairs and staircase landings of the exit of a building of over two storeys and P1 fire class must be made of at least A2s1, d0

class building materials. 

No fire resistance requirements are prescribed for roof structures of an attic or void that are not essential loadbearing struc

tures of the buildings structural body or structures that brace the structural body in a fire. 

1) Essential parts of the structural body are the main trusses, the secondary trusses that brace the structural body and the stiff

eners for the uppermost floor, and other such individual structures that act to preserve the stability of the uppermost floor, 

plus the connections between them.

Thermal insulation products and other fillings must be at least A2s1, d0class. 

The essential insulating part of thermal insulation products and other fillings must be at least Ds2, d2class. 

Loadbearing structures must be at least A2s1, d0class. 

Section 13 

Design of loadbearing structures based on design fire scenario 

When the design of loadbearing structures is based on a design fire scenario, a building is 

considered sufficiently firesafe with respect to loadbearing structures if: 

1) A twostorey building that is demanding in terms of personal safety, and a building of more 

than two storeys, can be reasonably trusted not to collapse during the fire or cooling phase; 

2) A building of one or two storeys does not collapse during the period of time required for 

securing evacuation, rescue operations and controlling the fire. 

The conditions represented by the design fire scenario are used as the fire exposure in such a 

way that the fire exposure is likely to cover the situations that will arise in the building in ques

tion. The design criteria are set out in Table 4. 

In design of the loadbearing structures that is based on a design fire scenario, a slower rise in 

temperature and the cooling of loadbearing building elements may be taken into consideration 

provided that the building is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suita

ble for its purpose.

The study is carried out for a completely developed fire. If it can be demonstrated that no flashover will occur, the design can be 

made for a local fire. Flashover is regarded as having taken place if the average temperature of the hot smoke layer reaches 

500 degrees Celsius, or if the radiation from the smoke layer to the floor exceeds 20 kW/m2.  

Chapter 3 

Prevention of the spread of fire from a fire compartment 

Section 14 

Fire compartmentation of a building and partitioning of a fire compartment 

A building shall, if its size, number of storeys or an intended purpose of a premises within the 

building so requires, be divided into fire compartments in order to restrict the spread of fire and 

smoke, to provide safe evacuation and to facilitate rescue and extinguishing measures.  

The various storeys, basement storeys and the attic of a P1 and P2 fire class building must be 

made into separate fire compartments (fire compartmentation by storey), and the same applies 

to the basement storeys of fire class P3 that serve more than one apartment. A fire compartment 

may, however, comprise several storeys, excluding compartments with rooms for accommoda

tion or patient rooms, with the following restrictions: 

1) in a building whose height exceeds 28 metres, no more than two storeys above this height 

of 28 metres may comprise a single fire compartment, excluding the staircase, and the size of a 

single fire compartment must not exceed 2,400 square metres; and 

2) at a height of over 56 metres, a fire compartment is restricted to a single storey, apart from 

residential apartments, where twostorey fire compartments are permitted, and staircases. In this 

case, access must be arranged to an exit from both storeys of the residential apartment.  

The size of a fire compartment must be limited so that a fire igniting in the compartment does 

not cause unreasonably vast damages (compartmentation by area). 

Premises with essentially different uses, or with essentially different fire loads, must be set up 

as  separate  fire  compartments  (compartmentation  by  use).  However,  assembly  and  business 

premises, office premises and accommodation premises and institutions other than overnight 

accommodation areas may be located in the same fire compartment, provided that this does not 

jeopardise personal safety and that all the fire technical requirements of all the premises located 

in the same fire compartment are met.  

If necessary, fire compartments shall be partitioned in order to restrict the spread of fire and 

smoke, to provide safe evacuation and to facilitate rescue and extinguishing measures.

BASEMENT STOREYS 

Attics and uppermost floor voids shall be divided into 400 m2 parts. 

Base floor voids shall be divided into 400 m2 parts if the areas surfaces (apart from minor parts) do not meet the Ds2, d2class 

requirements. 

1) The building is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for its purpose, apart from a residential 

building of two to four storeys, where all storeys of each housing unit belong to one and the same apartment and whose height 

does not exceed 14 m. 

2) The fire compartment shall be partitioned by accommodation room. 

3) The surface area of an open garage compartment may be 50 per cent greater. 

4) In an open garage of no more than five storeys, the maximum area may be used as the surface area of the storeys, even though 

the driveways between the various storeys are combined. This, however, requires that the class of the intermediate floors be at 

least REI 60. 

5) The surface area of a fire compartment may be increased by a maximum of 50 per cent if the area is provided with a fire alarm 

system that is linked to the emergency centre and effective extinguishing work can be commenced at a sufficiently early stage. 

 When the building or premises is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for its purpose. 

Section 16 

Fire compartmenting building elements and partitioning building elements 

Fireseparating building elements together with any attached installations and equipment must 

prevent the spread of fire from one fire compartment to another for a specified period of time. 

The class requirements for fireseparating building elements are set out in Table 6. A building 

element that entirely or in some respects meets the requirements only in the case of integrity E 

may also be approved as a fireseparating building element. In this case, the exit of persons must 

not be endangered nor must the fire spread to another fire compartment within the required fire 

resistance time. 

The class requirement for a partitioning building element is EI 15.

Section 17 

Fire doors, windows and shutters 

The fire resistance time of a door, small window and other building elements covering rela

tively small openings in a fireseparating building element shall have at least half of the fire 

resistance time required for the fireseparating building element. The fire resistance time of a 

building element that protects an opening in an intermediate floor and in the fire compartment

ing wall of a basement storey whose floor is at a distance greater than 14 metres from the build

ings entry level must be the same as that of the fireseparating building element. 

A fire door must be selfclosing and selfbolting. However, no door closer is required in sto

reylevel doors of residential apartments in buildings of less than 56 metres in height.  

If a fire door is kept open in normal use, it shall be equipped with devices that will close the 

door in the event of fire.  

Partitioning doors in accommodation premises shall be equipped with closing devices. 

Section 18 

Penetrations in firecompartmented structures 

Pipes, shafts, ducts, cables and flues, and penetrations required by conveyors that are mounted 

through a fireseparating building element must not essentially reduce the fire compartmenting 

capacity of the building element. 

Section 19 

Ventilation system 

The ventilation system must not increase the hazard of spreading fire or gaseous combustion 

products. 

The walls of ventilation ducts servicing more than one fire compartment or partition must be 

made of building materials of at least class A2s1, d0.  

Section 20 

Attics and voids 

Attics and voids shall be built in such a way that the hazard of ignition of fire and spread of 

fire and smoke within the building is not essentially increased thereby. 

Extensive voids must be partitioned in order to restrict the spread of fire.  

The spread of fire in voids of walltype building elements must be restricted at least by storey.  

Section 21 

External walls and balconies 

External walls and balconies shall be constructed so that a fire will not spread from one fire 

compartment to another through them for a specified period of time. 

In glazed balconies, the spread of fire from one balcony to another and to an adjacent fire 

compartment must be restricted. The fire compartmenting requirement for the balcony slab of a 

glazed balcony of a building exceeding two storeys is EI 30; however, minor sealing parts and 

penetrations may be class E 15. If the free gap between facing walls of adjacent glazed balconies 

or the distance of the wall to the window of an adjacent fire compartment is less than 2 metres, 

the wall in question must be class EI 15.  

Chapter 4 

Limitation of development of fire 

Section 22 

General requirements 

The building materials used in the building must not contribute to the development of a fire 

in a hazardous manner. 

Section 23 

Internal surfaces 

The class requirements for internal surfaces are set out in Table 7. 

The class requirements do not apply to building elements with a small surface area, such as 

ordinary doors, windows, attachment surfaces, handrails, skirtings and joints between boards. 

Nor do the requirements apply to beams and columns that meet the class requirements R 30 and 

Ds2, d2 and are located in a building of no more than two storeys. 

Surfaces may be coated with an unclassified layer of filler, painters filler or paint or wallpa

per, which does not essentially affect the characteristics of the class required for the relevant 

surface. 

Requirements that are one main class lower may be permitted for surfaces if, considering the 

use of the fire compartment, the hazard of ignition or spread of fire is smaller than normal. This 

does not, however, apply to internal corridors, exits or areas for which the class requirement is 

Ds2, d2.

Section 24 

Protective coverings of internal surfaces 

The internal wall and roof surfaces of a building of fire class P2 and of one to two storeys 

must be fitted with a protective covering of K2 10 class, made of at least Bs1, d0class building 

materials. However, no protective covering is required: 

1) if the insulating parts of thermal insulation products are at least class Bs1, d0;  

2) for walls, where the construction product forming their inner and outer surface, including 

joints, meets class requirement Bs1, d0 (inner surface) and EI 15 (as building element). The 

above does not apply to dwellings, accommodation premises and institutions; 

3) for walls of a onestorey production or storage building with no attic, where the inner sur

face meets class requirement Bs1, d0, apart from exits; 

4) for the uppermost floor of a onestorey production or storage building that has no attic and 

that belongs to fire hazard class 1, where the construction product forming their inner and outer 

surface, including joints, meets class requirement Bs1, d0 (inner surface) and REI 15 (as build

ing element). 

5) for nonloadbearing ceilings of a onestorey production or storage building that has no 

attic and that belongs to fire hazard class 1, where the construction product forming their lower 

and upper surface, including joints, meets class requirement Bs1, d0 (lower surface) and EI 15 

(as building element). 

6) for the surfaces of a dwelling, if the insulating parts of thermal insulation products meet at 

least the Ds2, d2class requirements; 

7) for beams and columns that meet R 30 and Ds2, d2class requirements. 

The surfaces of an exit and an exit enclosure of a building of fire class P2 and more than two 

storeys, apart from the top and front surface of landings and stairs, must be fitted with a protec

tive  covering  of  K2 10  class,  made  of  at  least  A2s1,  d0class  building  materials.  Protective 

covering is not, however, required for minor building elements or for building elements that 

(apart from minor structural parts) are made of building materials of at least A2s1, d0 class.  

The inner surfaces of a building of fire class P2 and more than two storeys, apart from exit 

and exit enclosure surfaces, must be fitted with a protective covering of K2 30 class, made of at 

least  A2s1,  d0class  building  materials.  A  protective  covering  is  not,  however,  required for 

building elements that (apart from minor structural parts) are made of building materials of at 

least A2s1, d0 class, or for the nonloadbearing internal dividing walls of a fire compartment. 

Nor is protective covering required for a wall or roof surface when its share of the total surface 

area of the loadbearing, fire compartmenting and exterior walls and roof of the fire compart

ment is: 

1) no more than 20 per cent;  

2) over 20 per cent, but no more than 80 per cent and the fire resistance time of loadbearing 

and fireseparating building elements has been extended by 30 minutes; 

3) over 80 per cent and the fire resistance time of loadbearing and fireseparating building 

elements has been extended by 60 minutes. 

However, the internal surfaces of a residential building of fire class P2, of three or four storeys 

and with a height not exceeding 14 metres may be fitted with a protective covering of at least 

K2 10 class made of building materials of at least A2s1, d0 class, if the surfaces are given a 

protective covering in their entirety. 

The inner surfaces of a building of fire class P1 and more than two storeys, whose skeletal 

framework is not at least A2s1, d0 class, must be fitted with a protective covering of K2 30 

class, made of at least A2s1, d0class building materials. The above does not apply to a fire 

compartments nonloadbearing internal dividing walls. 

Section 25 

General requirements for external wall 

The external wall of a building of fire class P1 must be mainly constructed of building mate

rials of at least class A2s1, d0.  

The thermal insulation products and other fillings of a P2 fire class building of over two sto

reys and of a P1 fire class building of over 56 metres in height must be at least A2s1, d0 class. 

In a P1 fire class building not exceeding 56 metres in height, a thermal insulation product may 

be used whose insulating part meets the Bs1, d0class requirements, or a thermal insulation 

product that is protected and positioned in such a way that the spread of fire into the thermal 

insulation  product  is  limited  for  a  time  that  in  the  case  of  the  building  interior  and  sides  of 

openings  is  at  least  half  of  the  fire  resistance  time  requirement  of  the  areas  fireseparating 

building elements. A thermal insulation product whose insulating part does not meet the Ds2, 

d2class requirement must be cut with fire partitionat most twostorey intervals up to a height 

of  28  metres,  and  thereafter  at  singlestorey  intervals,  by  a  building  material  that  limits  the 

spread of fire in the thermal insulation product. 

The frame of a nonloadbearing external wall of a P1 fire class building no more than 56 

metres in height can consist of Ds2, d2class building materials. 

The fire performance of the external wall structure of a building no more than 56 metres in 

height may also be demonstrated by a fullscale test. 

Section 26 

Class requirements for surfaces of external walls and ventilation gaps  

The class requirements for surfaces of external walls and ventilation gaps are set out in Ta

ble 8.  

Surfaces may be coated with an unclassified layer of filler, painters filler or paint that do not 

essentially affect the characteristics of the class required for the relevant surface.

P3 fire class building 

Balconies shall comply with the requirements set for the outer surface of an exterior wall. However, the requirement for the surfaces 

(excluding floors) of a balcony designed for use as a fire escape of a building not exceeding 28 metres in height is Bs2, d0.  By way 

of derogation from the above, the beams and columns of a balcony of a P2 fire class building of more than two storeys may be class 

Ds2, d2, if the balcony is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for its purpose. The requirements 

shall not apply to minor surfaces such as hand railings.  

In the case of an openaccess balcony, compliance shall be made with the requirements set for an exit. However, the walls and col

umns of the openaccess balcony of a P2 fire class building of not more than two storeys may be class Ds2, d2.   The beams and 

columns of an openaccess balcony of a P2 fire class building of more than two storeys may be class Ds2, d2, if the access balcony 

is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for its purpose. The requirements shall not apply to minor 

surfaces such as hand railings. 

The mounting accessories for the facade cladding may, to a small extent, be of class Ds2, d2 in a building with a height not exceed

ing 28 m. 

1) If the insulating part of a thermal insulation product does not meet the Bs1, d0 requirements, the surface structures of the external 

surface must protect the thermal insulation product from fire in such a way that the protection corresponds to an EI 30 building ele

ment, or the inner surface of the ventilation gap must be fitted with K2 30, A2s1, d0 protective covering. 

2) Apart from the first storey and the surfaces above and below the fire escapes, whose participation in a fire may jeopardise use of 

the fire escapes.  

3) The spread of fire in a ventilation gap must be restricted at each storey, and the spread of fire in a horizontal direction to the venti

lation gap in the external wall of a firecompartmented staircase must be prevented. 

4) The spread of fire from the facade into an attic and the uppermost floor must be restricted so that this corresponds to an EI 30

building element.  

5) The collapse of extensive parts of the facade structure in the event of a fire must be restricted. 

6) If the insulating part of a thermal insulation product does not meet the Bs1, d0 requirements, the surface structures of the external 

surface must protect the thermal insulation product from fire in such a way that the protection corresponds to an EI 15 building ele

ment, or the inner surface of the ventilation gap must be fitted with a K210, A2s1, d0 protective covering. 

7 The partitioning of thermal insulation products on each storey referred to in section 25 shall not be required if the requirements in 

comment 6) are met. 

8) An external wall and its windows and other openings must meet the EI 30 requirement. 

 The building is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for this purpose.  

Section 27 

Requirements for the uppermost floor 

The thermal insulation products and other filling of a P2 fire class building of over two storeys 

and of a P1 fire class building of over 56 metres in height must be at least A2s1, d0 class. 

In a P1 fire class building not exceeding 56 metres in height, a thermal insulation product may 

be used whose insulating part meets the Bs1, d0class requirements, or a thermal insulation 

product is protected and positioned in such a way that the spread of fire into the thermal insula

tion product is limited for a time that in the case of the building interior and sides of openings 

is at least the same as the fire resistance time requirement of the areas fireseparating building 

elements. By way of derogation from the above, however, it is sufficient that the spread of the 

fire into the thermal insulation product be restricted for a time that is at least half of the fire 

resistance time requirement of the areas fireseparating building elements: 

1) In a one or twostorey building with no attic; 

2) In a building not exceeding 28 metres in height, if the insulating part of the thermal insula

tion product meets the class Ds2, d2 requirement. 

Penetrations and other installations must be carried out in such a way that the protection of 

thermal insulation products does not deteriorate as a result of these. 

Section 28 

Roof 

A roof must not easily ignite from a fire at a neighbouring building.  

Fire must not spread in a roof or in its underlay in a way that causes a hazard.  

The roof must be BROOF(t2)class. A roof not belonging to the BROOF(t2) class may, however, 

be approved for a separate building that does not have a fireplace or, in a special case, for an

other building if this does not give rise to the risk of a regional fire. 

Large  roof  surfaces  must  be  divided  into  parts  of  no  more  than  2,400 square  metres. This 

requirement does not apply in cases where the underlay is of at least class A2s1, d0 or to other 

solutions whose level of fire safety can be regarded as acceptable.  

Chapter 5  

Prevention of the spread of fire to neighbouring buildings 

Section 29  

Distance between buildings 

The spread of fire from one building to another must not endanger personal safety or cause 

unacceptable economic or societal losses. 

The  distance  between  buildings  on  neighbouring  plots  or  construction  sites  (neighbouring 

building) must be such that fire does not spread easily to neighbouring buildings and that the 

hazard of regional fire remains small.  

If the distance between neighbouring buildings is less than 8 metres, limitation of the spread 

of fire shall be ensured through structural or other means.  

Section 30 

Fire wall 

A building must be provided with a fire wall if it is situated adjacent to a neighbouring build

ing or so close to a neighbouring building that the spread of fire is evident. 

The fire wall in a P0 and P1 fire class building and in a P2 fire class building whose height 

exceeds 14 metres must be made of A1class building materials, and the doors in it must be 

made of at least A2s1, d0class building materials. 

 The fire resistance time of the door in a fire wall or similar building element must be at least 

the same as the fire resistance time that the fire wall is required to have. 

 The class requirements for fire walls are set out in Table 9.

Leaving the building in case of fire 

Section 31 

General requirements 

It must be possible to leave a building safely in case of fire.  

A building shall be provided with an adequate number of appropriately located exits that are 

sufficiently spacious and passable, so that the time to leave the building will not be so long as 

to cause danger. 

Exits shall lead outside to the ground level or to some other safe place in case of fire. 

An exit or a exit enclosure must not be constructed from such building materials or building 

elements and must not house such equipment or installations that would increase the fire load 

in a way that cannot be regarded as acceptable, or that would jeopardise personal safety due to 

smoke formation. 

Section 32 

Maximum length of passageway to nearest exit 

The length of a passageway to the nearest exit must not be so long as to constitute a hazard. 

Table 10 sets out the maximum length of a passageway to the nearest exit on the basis of the 

use of the evacuation area.  

The distance from each point of the evacuation area to an exit can be determined along the 

shortest passable route. If the passageways to two separate exits partly join, the length of the 

common part must be doubled in the calculation. When calculating the length of a passageway, 

the level differences in the passageway must be taken into account.

1) Safe place refers to access directly to the outside or to another safe place. 

f The evacuation area is provided with a fire escape that is suitable for this purpose. 

 The building is provided with an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for this purpose. 

If this does not pose a hazard to personal safety, one exit may also be regarded as sufficient 

in a single storey: 

1) accommodation building, whose rooms are entered directly from outside; 

2) an institution intended for no more than 10 clients; 

3) small assembly and business premises.  

Evacuation areas must have a fire escape if this is required for personal safety reasons. 

Exits of parts of the building separated by a fire wall must be constructed separately so that in 

the event of a fire there is no need to use any door that may be in the fire wall. 

Section 34 

Dimensions of exits 

The minimum width of an exit shall be calculated on the basis of the number of occupants 

evacuating through the exit. The number of occupants of an evacuation area may be distributed 

between different exits, and the widths of the exits added up. 

The highest number of occupants intended to be present in an evacuation area shall be used 

as the number of occupants. If several evacuation areas are connected to the same exit, the width 

of the exit shall be designed according to the evacuation area with the highest number of occu

pants. 

The width of an exit must be at least 1,200 millimetres and its free height must be at least 

2,100 millimetres. However, by way of derogation from the above: 

1) in an evacuation area where the maximum number of occupants is 60, the second exit may 

be no less than 900 millimetres in width;  

2) in residential buildings of not more than two storeys, one exit of no less than 900 millime

tres in width is permitted; 

3) If a lift or other device for moving between levels is installed in the exit of an existing 

building, the dwellings exit may be no less than 850 millimetres wide.  

If the number of occupants exceeds 120, the total minimum width of the exits shall be calcu

lated by increasing the original 1,200 millimetres by 400 millimetres for each additional group 

of 60 people. 

The width of an internal corridor leading to an exit is calculated in the same way as the width 

of the exit according to the number of occupants passing along the corridor. 

Section 35 

Doors used for evacuation 

The number and width of doors leading to exits and from rooms to internal corridors must be 

adequate in relation to the number of occupants using them.  

The doors of exits, and of areas leading to them, must be easy to open in an emergency. In the 

case of the storeylevel door of a dwelling, or if the number of people evacuating through the 

door exceeds 60, doors must open in the direction of the exit. 

Section 36 

Calculation of evacuation time 

For sites that are demanding from the aspect of personal safety, where risks to evacuation 

safety arise from the use or location of the premises and from the restricted or reduced capacity 

of  the  occupants, the building  inspection authority  may  require  a sitespecific  calculation  of 

evacuation time to be carried out as part of the safety report referred to in section 117 b of the 

Land Use and Building Act.  

Performance of an evacuation time calculation may also be a requirement for other sites if 

their large size or exceptional circumstances may jeopardise personal safety. 

Section 37 

Safety report 

The safety report referred to in section 117 b of the Land Use and Building Act must state: 

a) how long, on average, it will take to evacuate the occupants (by their own means or, taking 

account of the use of the premises, with help) from fire compartments and from partitions of a 

fire compartment (i.e. a fire compartment that is partitioned into separate rooms), 

b) an estimate of how long the formation of hazardous conditions will take in a room and in a 

fire compartment, and 

c) an estimate of whether there is sufficient time for evacuation or rescue from the hazardous 

conditions. 

If the estimated time is not sufficient for evacuation or rescue from the hazardous conditions, 

the  building  project  promoter  shall  order  structural  or  other  necessary  measures  in  order  to 

achieve the safety level necessary from the aspect of personal safety.  

If the location, large size or exceptional conditions of the building pose a particular hazard to 

personal safety, the building inspection authority may, for good reasons, require that the build

ing be provided with equipment or arrangements to improve fire safety where this is necessary. 

Chapter 7 

Fire technical installations 

Section 38 

Smoke detector and fire alarm system 

Dwellings, accommodation premises, institutions, daycare institutions, daycare centres and 

other  early  childhood  education  premises and schools  must  be  provided  with  an  appropriate 

system that gives a warning at an early stage of a beginning fire. 

Table 12 shall apply to the provision of a building with a system that gives warning at an early 

stage of a beginning fire.

Automatic fireextinguishing system 

There must be an automatic fireextinguishing system that is suitable for its purpose and con

nected to the emergency centre: 

1) in a P2 fire class building of over two storeys, including balconies that are designed for use 

as fire escapes. This requirement does not apply to a residential building of fire class P2 and 

more than two storeys, where all the storeys of each housing unit belong to one and the same 

apartment and the height of the building does not exceed 14 metres; 

2) in an exit that serves more than one evacuation area in a fire class P2 building of over two 

storeys. An automatic fireextinguishing system will not, however, be required if the exits load

bearing and compartmenting structures and the staircases and landings, apart from the top sur

face  of  storey  levels  and stairs  and  minor  installations,  are  made  of  at  least  class  A2s1,  d0 

building materials; 

3) in a P1 fire class building of over two storeys and with a height of over 56 metres. 

Chapter 8 

Organisation of firefighting and rescue operations 

Section 40 

Prerequisites for rescue and firefighting work 

The prerequisites for extinguishing fires and rescuing people in a building and in its vicinity 

shall be taken into account in the design. 

It must be possible for fire and service rescue equipment to have sufficiently close access to 

the building (emergency access road). 

There must be access to each fire compartment of an attic for firefighting operations. If the 

height of the building does not exceed 28 metres, access to the attic fire compartments from the 

outside shall be required. 

Extinguishing routes to basement storeys shall be arranged so that basement storeys can be 

reached from the ground level without a need to pass through the exits of the storeys. The min

imum width of an extinguishing route is 900 millimetres. However, if a lift or other device for 

moving between levels is installed in the exit of an existing building, the minimum width of an 

extinguishing route shall be at least 850 millimetres. A basement that forms part of a single 

dwelling does not need to have a separate extinguishing route.  

Extinguishing routes of basement storeys must not be connected to fire and smokeproof exits. 

Connection to a fireproof exit may be arranged via an exit enclosure, and to an exit passageway 

via a fire door. 

Section 41 

Lift used in rescue and firefighting work 

A lift must be available for use in rescue and extinguishing work (firefighting lift); 

1) in areas above the entrance level when the distance of the floor of the uppermost storey 

exceeds 38 metres from the buildings entrance level; 

2) in areas below the entrance level when the distance of the floor of the basement storey 

exceeds 14 metres from the buildings entrance level and the surface area of that basement sto

reys evacuation area exceeds 800 m2; 

The internal dimensions of the lift cage must be suitable for the conveyance of a stretcher. 

Section 42 

Smoke extraction 

In  order  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  firefighting  and  rescue  operations,  means  of  smoke 

extraction shall be designed and constructed in the building so that smoke can be extracted from 

the different premises in the building. 

In exit passageways and firecompartmented elevator shafts, means must be arranged for both 

smoke extraction and flow of replacement air.  

Means shall be provided for smoke extraction from the spaces of the basement storey, so that 

it  will  not  be  necessary  to  use  exit  passageways  or  compartmented  extinguishing  routes  for 

smoke extraction. 

If so required on justified grounds, smoke extraction shall be arranged using special measures, 

such as smoke vents, smoke venting windows, smoke venting fans or windows located in the 

upper part of the rooms and that are easy to open. 

Section 43 

Fixed dry riser 

A building shall be provided with a permanently installed dry riser that is suitable for its pur

pose for transporting water for fire extinguishing:  

1) in the premises above the entry level of the building, when the distance of the uppermost 

floor level from the entry level exceeds 24 metres; 

2) in the premises below the entry level of the building, when the distance of the basement 

storey floor from the entry level exceeds 14 metres. 

Section 44 

Entry into force 

This Decree enters into force on 1 January 2018.  

Upon the entry into force of this Decree, pending projects shall be subject to the rules valid at 

the time of entry into force of this Decree.
