This Decree applies to buildings with dwellings or accommodation or patient rooms, facilities 

for teaching, meeting, eating, treatment, recreation or physical exercise, or office spaces.  

This  Decree  applies to the  construction  of  a new  building,  repair and  alteration  work  of  a 

building, and alteration of the intended use of a building in building planning, building permit 

procedure and building supervision under the Land Use and Building Act (132/1999).

1) weighted standardised level difference (DnT,w) means the measure describing the airborne 

sound insulation between room spaces; 

2) weighted standardised impact sound pressure level (LnT,w  C1,502500) means the measure 

describing the impact sound insulation between room spaces; 

3) Aweighted equivalent continuous sound level (LAeq,T) means the measure describing the 

level of nontemporary noise in a room or outdoor space; 

4) maximum sound pressure level (LAFmax,T)  means the measure describing the intermittent 

shortterm noise level of nontemporary sound in a room or outdoor space; 

5) reverberation time (T) means the measure describing the reverberance in a room space; 

6) structureborne noise means the noiseinducing mechanical vibration in a structure or other 

solid object; 

7) vibration means the annoying mechanical vibration observed by humans. 

 Directive 2015/1535/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (32015L1535); OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1 

Section 3  

Design and construction of the acoustic environment of a building 

The noise and vibration at the site of the building shall be taken into account in the design and 

construction of the building.  

The essential technical characteristics concerning the acoustic environment of a building are 

fulfilled if in the design and implementation of the sound insulation and noise and vibration 

abatement of the building and the acoustic conditions consideration is given to the intended use 

of the space as laid down in this Decree.  

If it is not practicable to apply the procedure referred to in subsection 2 on account of the 

special characteristics of the building or the acoustic environment outside it, special use of the 

space or user group or some other special reason, the party initiating the building project shall 

in connection with the building permit procedure demonstrate that, considering the intended use 

of  the  space,  the  design  process  will  lead  to  the  fulfilment  of  the  essential  technical 

characteristics with regard to the sound insulation, noise and vibration abatement and acoustic 

conditions. 

Section 4 

Requirements for the sound insulation of a new building 

In the design and implementation of airborne sound insulation and impact sound insulation of 

dwellings  and  accommodation  and  patient  rooms,  the  following  numerical  values  shall  be 

observed: 

Room space 

Minimum permitted weighted 

standardised level difference 

(DnT,w ), in dB 

Maximum permitted weighted 

standardised impact sound pressure 

level (LnT,w  C1,502500 ), in dB 

Between dwellings or 

accommodation or patient rooms 

From the exit route to a residential, 

accommodation or patient room 

If the dwelling or accommodation or patient room is structurally connected with spaces where 

intense,  particularly  annoying  or  lowfrequency  noise  is  generated,  in  the  design  and 

implementation process special consideration shall be given to the implementation of sufficient 

sound  insulation.  In  rooms  used  for  sleeping  or  rest,  the  onehour  Aweighted  equivalent 

continuous sound level of impulsive, narrowband or lowfrequency noise may not exceed 25 

decibels.  

Considering  the  intended  use  of  the  space,  the  sound  insulation  of  facilities  for  teaching, 

meeting, eating, treatment, recreation or physical exercise or office spaces shall be designed and 

implemented so that the acoustic environment achieved adequately meets the requirements for 

the activities carried out in the space. The sound insulation of recessed balconies, conservatories 

and roof terraces shall be designed and implemented so that the acoustic environment does not 

cause any inconvenience to the residents. 

Section 5 

Requirements for noise and vibration abatement in a new building 

The  sound  insulation  of  the  envelope  of  a  building  with  dwellings  or  accommodation  or 

patient  rooms  shall  be  designed  and  implemented  so  that  the  sound  insulation  is  at  least  30 

decibels and the Aweighted equivalent continuous sound level of impulsive, narrowband or 

lowfrequency noise in rooms used for sleeping or rest does not exceed 25 decibels. 

The installation of lifts in a building and technical building systems shall be designed and 

implemented  so  that  the  noise  level  generated  by  them  in  residential  or  other  spaces  in 

dwellings, accommodation or patient rooms, outside openable windows or air vents of the same 

building or adjacent residential buildings, on balconies used by residents, or in yards or other 

spaces intended for use by residents does not exceed the following numerical values: 

Room and outdoor space 

Continuous broadband noise 

Impulsive or narrowband noise 

Aweighted 

equivalent 

continuous sound 

level (LAeq,T), in 

Maximum sound 

pressure level 

(LAFmax,T), in dB 

Aweighted 

equivalent 

continuous 

sound level 

(LAeq,T), in dB 

Maximum sound 

pressure level 

(LAFmax,T), in dB 

Residential room or  

accommodation or patient 

room 

Residential kitchen or 

recreational room in a 

building 

Staircase or exit route 

Outdoor space 

Considering the intended use of the space, the structureborne noise and vibration insulation 

of a building with dwellings or accommodation or patient rooms and the noise and vibration 

abatement of facilities for teaching, meeting, eating, treatment, recreation or physical exercise 

and office spaces shall be designed and implemented so that the acoustic environment achieved 

adequately meets the requirements for the activities carried out in the space. 

Section 6 

Requirements for the acoustic conditions of a new building 

The acoustic conditions of a building with patient rooms and facilities for teaching, meeting, 

eating,  treatment,  recreation  or  physical  exercise  and  office  spaces  shall  be  designed  and 

implemented so that the speech discrimination achieved in the space is adequate considering 

the intended use of the space. 

A  building  with  dwellings  or  accommodation  or  patient  rooms  shall  be  designed  and 

implemented so that the reverberation time of the staircase and exit route is no more than 1.3 

seconds. Yards and spaces intended for use by residents of a building and balconies used by 

residents  shall  be  designed  and  implemented  so  that  the  Aweighted  equivalent  continuous 

sound level between 7.00 and 22.00 does not exceed 55 decibels and, similarly, conservatories 

so that the Aweighted equivalent continuous sound level does not exceed 45 decibels.  

Section 7 

Repair construction, alteration work and change in the intended use of a building 

Repair  or  alteration  work  of  a  building  shall  not  weaken  the  sound  insulation,  noise  and 

vibration abatement or acoustic conditions of the building or the noise abatement or acoustic 

conditions of yards, spaces intended for use by residents and balconies used by residents.   

When the intended use of the building is altered, the sound insulation, noise and vibration 

abatement and acoustic conditions of the building as well as the noise abatement and acoustic 

conditions of yards, spaces intended for use by residents and balconies used by residents shall 

be  designed  and  implemented  so  that  the  acoustic  environment  does  not  cause  any 

inconvenience to the residents. 

Section 8 

Entry into force 

This Decree enters into force on 1 January 2018. 

Upon the entry into force of this Decree, pending projects shall be subject to the rules valid at 

the time of entry into force of this Decree.
