Snow load on roofs 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (6/16) 

concerning national choices for snow loads, when applying standard SFSEN 199113 

Section 3 Snow load on roofs 

For different topography, the value of exposure coefficients given in table 5.1 clause 5.2(7) of the standard shall be 

used. For large roofs, where the smaller horizontal dimension of the roof is 50 m or more, and the topography is 

windswept, the value of the exposure coefficient shall be at least 1.  

For different topographies, where the smaller horizontal dimension of the roof is at least 50 m, the exposure 

coefficient shall be increased based on the smaller horizontal dimension and side ratio, according to the factors in 

Table 1.

In determining the snow load, in accordance with clause 5.2(8) of the standard, when the thermal insulating properties 

of the roof structure are insignificant, the thermal coefficient Ct may be reduced on the basis of a more exact study. 

The value to be used for snow load s, however, is at least 0.5 kN/m2.  

Instruction  

The  removal  of  snow  from  the  roof  or  the  redistribution  of  snow,  clause  5.2(5)  of  the 

standard,  is  taken  into  account  by  designing  the  roof  with  the  appropriate  load 

arrangements.      When  dimensioning  continuous  structures,  the  uneven  removal  of  snow 

from a roof is taken into account by means of a load arrangement where the snow load varies 

between 50 and 100 in different fields. 

Load arrangements

Instruction 

Scope 

1.1(10) 

Persistent thermal surface inversion occurs in the northern part of Finland every winter. This 

phenomenon is occasionally also met in other parts of the country. A stratified flow 

condition may arise during thermal inversion such that high wind velocities prevail above a 

layer of moderate or no wind. Therefore, additional guidance is given later for the 

orography factor (clause 4.3.2) and for the calculation of the cross wind amplitude due to 

vortex shedding (clause E.1.5).  

The effect of thermal surface inversion can be seen in the wind speeds that correspond to a 

return period of 50 years.  

2.  Basic values 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 2 Basic values 

In Finland, the fundamental value of the basic wind velocity vb,0 is 21 m/s, in accordance with clause 4.2(1)P of the 

standard. This value applies to the entire country, including sea and mountain areas. 

Instruction 

When used together with the orography factor co(z) and the other instructions provided in 

standard SFSEN 199114, the selected basic value will lead to wind load values that are 

conservative in the entire country, including mountainous areas. For sea areas, however, an 

adjustment pursuant to section 3 is required in the value of the terrain factor.    

 Terrain roughness 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 3 Terrain roughness 

When determining the roughness factor, cr(z), for terrain category 0, the terrain factor is taken as kr  0.18, instead of the 

value derived from Equation 4.5. 

Instruction 

Wind velocity in sea areas would be underestimated if Equation (4.5) were used to obtain 

the terrain factor. Therefore, the value of kr  0.18 arising from statistical data is used for 

the terrain factor in sea areas.  

4.  Peak velocity pressure 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 4 Peak velocity pressure 

The value of the air density  is the recommended value 1.25 kg/m3, in accordance with clause 4.5(1) of the standard. 

When designing slender special structures, the value of the air density shall be calculated at the altitude and temperature 

relevant to the site and load conditions concerned.  

Instruction  

Note 2 for clause 4.5(1) of the standard 

The air density is obtained from the expression:  

  353/T  e0.00012 H  

where 

is the air density (kg/m3) at the load condition concerned 

is the absolute air density (K) at the load condition concerned 

is the altitude (m) above the sea level at the site 

5.  Pressure and force coefficients for vertical walls of rectangular plan 

buildings 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 5 Pressure and force coefficients for vertical walls of rectangular plan buildings 

The reference heights, ze, for leeward walls and sidewalls, clause 7.2.2(1) of the standard, shall be calculated as for 

windward walls. 

For the values of external pressure coefficients, clause 7.2.2(2) of the standard, when h/d is greater than 5, the values of 

coefficients cpe,10 and cpe,1 in row h/d  5 in Table 7.1 of the standard shall be used. 

6.  Annex A: Terrain effects 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 6 Annex A: Terrain effects 

For the transition between terrain categories, Procedure 1 under clause A.2(1) in Annex A to the standard shall be 

followed. 

Instruction 

The recommended values of the upwind distance can be redefined if reliable data is 

available on the wind speeds in the transitional area between two terrain categories. 

The procedure 1 described in Annex A.2 is the preferred method to deal with the transition 

between terrain categories. In coastal city areas, however, the application of this method 

may lead to sudden and large discrepancies in the design of wind actions on adjacent 

buildings. In such conditions, the concept of the displacement height described in Annex A.5 

of standard SFSEN 199114 can be applied. The transitional area of the terrain categories 

can also be specified by using reliable measured data on wind velocities. 

7.  Annex E: Vortex shedding and aeroelastic instabilities 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (7/16) 

concerning national choices for wind actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199114 

Section 7 Annex E: Vortex shedding and aeroelastic instabilities 

A stratified flow condition is possible in most parts of the country. Therefore, of the approaches given in Annex E, clause 

E.1.5.1(1) of the standard, the approach given in clause E.1.5.3 shall be used.  

Instruction 

Vortex shedding occurs when vortices are shed alternately on opposite sides of the 

structure. This causes a variable load that is perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The 

structure may begin to vibrate if the frequency of the shedding of the vortices is the same as 

the natural frequency of the structure. 

The dynamic excitation due to vortex shedding may be amplified if the wind flow is laminar. 

These kinds of conditions that promote large amplitude vibrations have been met in Central 

Europe. Laminar wind flows are typical in conditions of temperature inversion, which is 

common in Finland. The calculation method presented in annex E.1.5.3 takes account of this 

amplification. However, the method presented in annex 1.5.2 does not have this 

characteristic. Therefore, the method described in E.1.5.3 is preferred in Finland.

clause 5.3(2) of the standard. 

Indicative temperatures for buildings above ground level 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (8/16) 

concerning national choices for thermal actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199115 

Section 3 Indicative temperatures for buildings above ground level  

The values in Table 5.2 of clause 5.3(2) of the standard for indicative temperatures for buildings above ground level 

shall apply as follows. 

The temperature values specified in the isotherm maps in Figures 1 and 2 are used for maximum shade air 

temperature (Tmax) and minimum shade air temperature (Tmin). 

For values of solar radiation effects T3, T4 and T5, T3  5 C, T4  10 C and T5 15 C are used for structural elements 

facing north and east.  

The following values are used for structural elements facing south and west or for horizontal structural elements: 

1) T3  10 C, T4  20 C and T5  30 C for structures with a large outer insulation mass (e.g. concrete sandwich 

structures); or 

2) T3  18 C, T4  30 C and T5  42 C for structures with a small outer insulation mass (e.g. sandwich structure with a 

sheet metal surface). 

When the absorption factor has been determined, the temperature may be selected on the basis of the absorption 

factor, regardless of the surface colour.  

Indicative temperatures for underground parts of buildings  

Ministry of the Environment Decree (8/16) 

concerning national choices for thermal actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199115

2.  Construction loads 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 2 Construction loads 

The limits of the area where construction loads may be moved shall be marked in the plans, in accordance with clause 

2.2(4) of the standard, when the magnitude of the actions is significant in terms of the structure. 

Instruction 

Significant loads may be caused by, for example, heavy equipment, heavy moving machinery, 

storage of  goods or  demolition  waste,  filling  and  excavation  work,  supporting  moulds  for 

upper floors and casting work. 

3.  Design situations to be verified 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 3 Design situations to be verified 

The design situation for wind actions during exceptional weather conditions shall be interpreted as an accidental design 

situation, in accordance with clause 3.1(1)P of the standard.  

There are no recommended values for return periods in clause 3.1(5) of the standard for the determination of 

characteristic values of variable actions during execution regarding the nominal duration of a design situation lasting no 

more than three days. 

In the determination of the characteristic values of variable actions, in accordance with clause 3.1(5) of the standard, a 

nominal duration of three days, to be chosen for short execution phases, corresponds to the extent in time of reliable 

meteorological predictions for the location of the construction site. In such a case, the magnitude of the action shall be 

chosen according to the meteorological predictions. The minimum value to be used for the fundamental value of the 

basic wind velocity is 10 m/s. 

The fundamental value of the basic wind velocity vb,0 during the execution for a nominal duration of up to three months is 

18 m/s, in accordance with clause 3.1(5) of the standard, and this may be applied in the entire country, including sea and 

mountain areas.  

For the combination of snow loads and wind actions, in accordance with clause 3.1(7) of the standard, no reductions are 

allowed if the snow loads and wind actions that are used are less than in persistent design situations. 

Instruction 

In the determination of snow load during the execution, the seasonal variation, length of 

the execution phase and removal of snow may be taken into account. However, when the 

snow load can occur, the minimum value of the load s should be at least 0.5 kN/m2. The 

load s is the load on the roof or on the structure. During the execution, when the snow load 

is affecting the floors and not the roof, the load may be taken as uniformly distributed and 

e.g. drifting due to obstacles need not to be taken into account. 

Instruction 

The peak velocity pressure during the execution for a nominal duration of up to three months 

is 75 of the value for the persistent design situation. For the wind load, this corresponds to 

a 5year return period. 

Imperfections and restraint actions  

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 4 Imperfections and restraint actions  

For a persistent design situation during execution, in accordance with clause 3.1(8) of the standard, the imperfections in 

the geometry of the structure and of structural members shall be those imperfections due to normal use of the 

completed structure. 

The imperfections to be defined, however, shall be determined on a projectbyproject basis when the execution includes 

stages where a structure or a structural member has an imposed load in a different position or location than when the 

structure or the structural member is in the final state. 

The imperfections caused by restraint actions and their deflections during erection work shall be taken into consideration. 

The imperfections caused by deflections in auxiliary construction works shall be taken into account if they differ from the 

imperfections of the persistent design situation. 

Serviceability limit states 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 5 Serviceability limit states 

Any deformation during execution shall not cause damage to adjacent structures nor to the surface materials of the 

structural members, in accordance with clause 3.3(2) of the standard. The deformation during execution can, however, 

be greater than the allowed deformation for the completed structure if the deformation is reversible when the actions 

due to execution are removed.  

The design situation during execution, compared to the persistent design situation, shall not cause larger crack widths 

in the structure and the cracking shall not reduce the stiffness of the structure, if this has not been taken into 

consideration in the persistent design situation. 

Auxiliary construction works shall be designed so that the tolerances of the completed structure are not exceeded, in 

accordance with clause 3.3(6) of the standard. 

6.  Actions due to atmospheric icing 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 6 Actions due to atmospheric icing  

Actions due to atmospheric icing shall be determined on a projectbyproject basis, in accordance with clause 4.10(1)P  

of the standard. 

Instruction 

The determination of ice loads is presented in the standards EN 19933 and ISO 12494. 

7.  Construction loads 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 7 Construction loads 

When considering construction loads, clause 4.11.1(1), Note 1 of the standard, the characteristic value of load qca,k is 

1.0 kN/m2. The characteristic value of load qca,k for precast slabs before grouting is 0.5 kN/m2. 

The characteristic values of loads qcb and Fcb for the actions caused by the temporary storage of material are determined 

on a projectbyproject basis, in accordance with clause 4.11.1(1), Note 3 of the standard. 

8.  Accidental actions 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 8 Accidental actions  

The dynamic amplification factor in accidental design situations is 2, in accordance with clause 4.12(1)P, Note 2 of the 

standard. 

The dynamic effects, clause 4.12(2) of the standard, are determined on a projectbyproject basis. Actions due to 

equipment falling or the dropping of equipment are taken into account where there is an exceptionally demanding work 

stage or structure, and where the equipment falling or the dropping of equipment will cause a disproportionately large 

amount of damage in relation to the initial incident. 

Structures shall be designed to take into account a human impact load as an accidental action, when stumbling could lead 

to a person falling or when the structure under consideration has to prevent the fall of a person.  

The design values of the human impact force to be used in the accidental design situation, clause 4.12(3) of the standard, 

are: 

1) 2.5 kN applied over an area of 200 mm x 200 mm; this design value takes into account a situation where a possible 

stumble does not lead to a person falling due to the collapse of the structure; or 

2) 10.0 kN applied over an area of 300 mm x 300 mm or the action is applied to fastening points for safety devices. This is 

to verify the design of protective structures, and the resistance of the fastenings, that will prevent the fall of a person.  

Instruction 

The design of fixed fastening points for safetylines on roofs 

Roof accessories and roof safety products to which persons working on roofs will fasten their 

safetylines are designed for the load caused by the falling of a person.   

The durability of the fitting or rooftop safety product and its fastening and substructure are 

verified by means of either testing or computational analysis. Testing is performed by means 

of a drop test pursuant to clause 8.2 of standard SFSEN 516. The computational analysis is 

performed in an accidental situation by using a design value of Ad  10 kN for the accidental 

action, acting in an arbitrary direction at the roof surface level at the height of the lifeline 

fastening point. The analysis does not need to account for other variable actions that may 

impact at the same time. 

If the rooftop safety products are CE labelled and designed for the fastening of a safetyline, 

only the durability of the substructure needs to be verified.  

The design of fixed fastening points for lifelines during the installation of the load bearing 

system 

The  fastening  points  for  safetylines  required  during  installation  are  designed  for  the  load 

caused by a falling person.  

The durability of the fastening point and substructure may be verified by means of either 

testing or computational analysis. Testing is performed by means of a drop test pursuant to 

clause 8.2 of standard SFSEN 516. The computational analysis is performed in an accidental 

situation  by  using  a  design  value  of  Ad    10  kN  for  the  accidental  action,  acting  at  the 

safetyline fastening point in the direction of the lifeline at the moment of falling. The analysis 

does not need to account for other variable actions that may impact at the same time. 

Design of removable and transferable fastening points  

Removable  and  transferable  fastening  points  are  covered  by  the  directive  on  personal 

protective equipment, and the requirements for the fastening point are set forth in standard 

SFSEN 795.  

9.     Annex A: Supplementary rules for buildings 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (9/16) 

concerning national choices for actions during execution, when applying standard SFSEN 199116 

Section 9 Annex A: Supplementary rules for buildings 

For ultimate limit state verifications, in clause A1.1(1), Note 2 of the standard, the recommended value to be used for the 

combination factor 0 for the variable action due to construction loads is 1.0, and the recommended value for the quasi

permanent combination factor 2 for the variable action is 0.3.  

The characteristic value of equivalent horizontal forces, clause A1.3(2) of the standard, is 3 of the vertical loads from the 

most unfavourable combination of actions. A lower value can be used if skewness of the vertical action during the 

execution can be estimated.  

When casting concrete, it shall be assumed that a variable horizontal point load acts in a random direction on the surface 

level of cast concrete, with a characteristic value of 1.5 kN.

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 2 Accidental action 

An accidental action, clause 2(2) of the standard, is considered a fixed action in those cases where the load is evenly 

distributed on the entire structure.  

3.  Accidental design situations 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 3 Accidental design situations 

The designer of a structure shall devise a strategy such that neither the whole building nor a significant part of it will 

collapse if localised failure is sustained. 

The  adoption  of  this  strategy  shall  provide  a  building  with  sufficient  robustness  to  not  succumb  to  various  types  of 

unspecified accidental actions. 

The minimum period that a  structure needs to remain  intact following an accident  should be that period needed to 

facilitate the safe evacuation and rescue of personnel from the building and its surroundings. Buildings used for handling 

hazardous materials, for providing essential services or for national security reasons may need to remain intact for longer 

periods. 

The party engaging the building project is not permitted, without the consent of the relevant authorities, in accordance 

with clause 3.1(2), Note 4 of the standard, to agree to the use of lower values for accidental actions in individual projects 

other than those given in SFSEN 199117 and in this Decree. 

4.  Accidental design situations  strategies for limiting the extent of 

localised failure  

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 4 Accidental design situations  strategies for limiting the extent of localised failure  

The acceptable limit of localised failure, in accordance with clause 3.3(2), Note 2 of the standard, depends on the type 

of building: 

1) In multistorey buildings, the localised failure may not exceed 15 of the floor area or 100 m2/storey. The failure may 

occur in two adjacent storeys; or 

2) If a column is damaged in halltype buildings, the acceptable limit of localised failure is the length of the main girders 

supported by the column, multiplied by two times the distance between the main girders. If the main girders are on the 

external wall line, the acceptable limit of localised failure is the combined length of the main girders, multiplied by the 

distance between the main girders.  

If the main girder of a halltype building is an arch or similar structure that does not have separate columns, the extent 

of localised failure may be the length of the main girder, multiplied by two times the distance between the main girders. 

If the main girder is on the external wall line, the acceptable limit of localised failure is the length of the main girder, 

multiplied by the distance between the main girders.  

If loadbearing walls form the vertical frame of a halltype building, the localised failure may not exceed the length of the 

horizontal structures supported by the wall, multiplied by 2H, where H is the height of the loadbearing wall. 

In halltype buildings, the failure may occur on one storey only.

In multistorey buildings, localised damage (initial collapse) will easily lead to a continuous 

collapse. If the extent of localised damage cannot be reliably assessed, localised damage 

cannot be allowed. In this case, the building shall be designed pursuant to section 6, using 

either tying systems or alternative load transfer routes.

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 5 Accidental design situations  use of consequences classes  

In the testing of accidental design situations to verify that a building or structure can remain intact, the Ministry of the 

Environment Decree concerning national choices for consequences classes, in accordance with standard SFSEN 1990, 

shall  apply.  For  the  strategies  for  accidental  design  situations,  in  accordance  with  clause  3.4(1)  of  SFSEN  199117, 

consequences classes CC2 and CC3 are divided into subclasses a and b based on the size of buildings and structures. The 

possible consequences are greater in subclass b than in subclass a.   

Instruction 

In an accidental limit state, the consequences class selected for the building pursuant to the 

national annex to standard SFSEN 1990 is divided into subclasses for the selection of the 

principle of operation laid down in item 3.4(1) of the standard as follows: 

1)  Consequences class CC1 includes 1 and 2storey buildings which  are  only  occasionally 

occupied by people, such as warehouses. 

2)  Consequences class CC2 subclass a, lower group, includes buildings with a maximum of 

four  aboveground  floors  or  whose  height  from  the  ground  is  a  maximum  of  16  m. 

However,  residential  buildings  with  a  maximum  of  two  aboveground  floors  may  be 

designed pursuant to consequences class 1 in an accidental limit state.  

3)  Consequences  class  CC2  subclass  b,  upper  group,  includes  all  other  buildings  and 

structures that are not in consequences classes 1, 2a or 3. 

4)  Consequences  class  CC3  subclass  a  includes  residential  buildings,  office  buildings, 

commercial  buildings  with  915  storeys  and  other  buildings  with  915  storeys  with  a 

similar  intended  use  and  load  bearing  system.  The  number  of  storeys  includes  any 

basement storeys. 

5)  Consequences class CC3 subclass b includes  

a) other buildings with more than 8 storeys, including a possible basement 

b) concert halls, theatres, sports and exhibitions halls and spectator galleries  

c) heavily loaded buildings or buildings with large spans that are often occupied by a large 

number of people 

d) special structures according to a casebycase assessment 

6.  Principles for ensuring the robustness of a building  

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 6 Principles for ensuring the robustness of a building 

Sufficient  robustness  for  a  multistorey  building  shall  be  ensured,  in  accordance  with  clause  3.3(2),  Note  3  of  the 

standard, by applying threedimensional tying for additional integrity or designing alternative load transfer path.  

The tying system shall be designed to increase the robustness and integrity of a building in the event of higher damage 

consequences. 

Alternative load paths shall be designed so that a localised failure does not exceed the limits given in section 4. 

When an alternative load path cannot be found or when such a method would lead to unreasonable structural solutions 

with regard to technical functionality, a method of designing key elements in accordance with clause 3.3(2)(a) of the 

standard may be used, thus considerably increasing the robustness of the building.  

In the designing of key elements, in accordance with clause 3.3(2), Note 1 of the standard, accidental action Ad shall be 

determined by carrying out a risk assessment and the grounds for the values used shall be included and recorded in the 

design documentation. Alternatively, the values recommended in the standard may be used. 

For buildings in consequences class CC3b, a systematic risk assessment of the building shall be undertaken, taking into 

account both foreseeable and unforeseeable hazards. If accidental actions can be determined by the risk assessment, 

they shall be taken into consideration in the design. Accidental actions include linear loads, concentrated loads, weight 

loads, deformations or deformation forces. 

Instruction 

Design of tying systems and calculating tying forces in different consequences classes. 

Buildings in consequences class CC1:  

Provided that a building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the rules 

given  in  SFSEN  1990...SFSEN  1999  for  satisfying  the  requirements  of  normal  design 

situation,  no  further  specific  consideration  is  necessary  with  regard  to  accidental  actions 

from unidentified causes. 

Buildings in consequences class CC2a: 

In addition  to  the operating  principles concerning consequences class CC1, horizontal ties 

shall be used in class CC2a buildings pursuant to clause 1.1 or horizontal structures shall be 

anchored to walls pursuant to clause 1.2.  

Buildings in consequences class CC2b: 

In  addition  to  the  operating  principles  concerning  consequences  class  CC1,  horizontal 

structures shall use horizontal ties pursuant to clause 1.1, vertical ties shall be used in all load 

bearing columns and walls pursuant to clause 2, and vertical structures shall be bound to 

horizontal structures pursuant to clause 1.2. 

Buildings in consequences class CC3a: 

In  addition  to  the  operating  principles  concerning  consequences  class  CC1,  horizontal 

structures shall use horizontal ties pursuant to clause 1.1, vertical ties shall be used in all load 

bearing columns and walls pursuant to clause 2, and vertical structures shall be bound to 

horizontal structures pursuant to clause 1.2. 

Buildings in consequences class CC3b: 

In addition to the operating principles concerning consequences class CC1, a systematic risk 

assessment of the building should be undertaken in order to account for both foreseeable 

and unforeseeable hazards. Regardless of the results of the risk assessment, the building shall 

meet the requirements of consequences class CC3a.  

Those parts of the building where the notional removal of a column or a loadbearing wall 

section pursuant to the definition in clause 3 would cause a horizontal structure that contains 

horizontal ties to act as an overhang that is the height of the horizontal structure shall also 

be  inspected.  If  such  a  notional  removal  of  a  structural  member  results  in  damage  that 

exceeds the acceptable limit, the structure marked for notional removal shall be considered 

a key structural member in the risk assessment.  

1.  Horizontal ties 

1.1 Peripheral and internal ties 

Horizontal peripheral and internal ties shall be provided around the perimeter of each floor 

and roof level and internally in two right angle directions. The ties shall be continuous and 

be arranged as closely as practicable to the edges of floors and lines of columns and walls. 

At least 30 of the ties shall be located in the immediate vicinity of the grid lines of the 

columns and the walls. 

The ties shall have such deformation capacity that they can act as a replacement load 

transfer structure or as part of a replacement load transfer structure. 

Horizontal ties may comprise timber sections, steel or aluminium sections,  reinforcement 

in concrete structures, or steel mesh reinforcement and and prefabricated reinforcing 

products made of sheet metal for composite slabs (if directly connected to the steel beams 

with shear connectors). The ties may consist of a combination of the above types. 

Each continuous tie, including its end connections, should be capable of sustaining a design 

tensile force for the accidental limit state, equal to the following values: 

Consequences classes CC2a and CC2b 

The tie forces T are based on the characteristic value of the permanent actions gk for the 

horizontal structure.  

Peripheral and internal ties: 

When the characteristic value of the permanent actions for the horizontal structure is        

gk  3.0 kN/m2:  

The minimum value for the tie force T is 70 kN for peripheral ties. If the internal ties must 

be centred on the supporting line, the minimum value of the tie force, 70 kN, will also be 

applied to internal ties (e.g. internal ties at the element end seams). 

When the characteristic value of the permanent actions for the horizontal structure is        

gk  2.0 kN/m2: 

The minimum value for the tie force T is 10 kN for peripheral ties. If the internal ties must 

be centred on the supporting line, the minimum value of the tie force, 10 kN, will also be 

applied to internal ties (e.g. internal ties at the element end seams). 

where: 

is, for internal ties, the distance between ties from centre to centre, and for peripheral 

ties, the distance between the peripheral tie and the closest internal tie divided by two 

plus the distance to the edge of the building (see Fig. 3). 

When the characteristic value gk of the permanent actions for the horizontal structure is 

between 2.0 and 3.0 kN/m2, the values for the tie forces can be obtained by interpolation.  

Tie forces:

Consequences classes CC3a and CC3b 

The tie forces T are based on the characteristic value of the permanent actions gk for the 

horizontal structure. In consequences classes CC3a and CC3b, the characteristic value for 

the permanent actions gk is usually greater than 3.0 kN/m2. If, however, the characteristic 

value of the permanent actions gk is smaller than this value, the tie forces may be defined 

on a project basis.

1.2 Horizontal ties to columns and walls 

Edge columns and walls shall be tied to every floor and roof. The tie forces are based on the 

characteristic value of the permanent actions gk for the horizontal structure. The ties should 

be capable of sustaining the following forces in accidental limit state: 

Consequences classes CC2a and CC2b 

  when the characteristic value of the permanent actions for the horizontal 

structure is gk  3.0 kN/m2 

  when the characteristic value of the permanent actions for the horizontal 

structure is gk  2.0 kN/m2

between 2.0 and 3.0 kN/m2, the values for the tie forces can be obtained by interpolation. 

Consequences classes CC3a and CC3b 

The tie forces are based on the characteristic value of the permanent actions gk for the 

horizontal structure. If the characteristic value of the permanent actions of the horizontal 

structure is gk  3.0 kN/m2, the below equation (6) may be applied. If the characteristic 

value of the permanent actions gk is smaller than this value, the tie forces may be defined

wall) 

Corner columns are tied in both directions. 

Peripheral or internal ties may be used for tying columns if the reinforcement is anchored 

to the columns. 

2. Vertical ties 

Each column and wall shall be supplied with continuous vertical ties from the foundations 

to the roof level. 

The columns and walls carrying vertical actions shall be capable of resisting an accidental 

design tensile force equal to the largest design vertical permanent and variable load 

reaction applied to the column from any one storey. The tensile force is anchored to the 

upper floor. 

The vertical ties in a loadbearing wall structure may be placed at the element seams or 

distributed along the length of the wall; the outermost vertical ties are located at a distance 

of at most 3 m from the freestanding end of the wall.  

3. Nominal section of a loadbearing wall 

The nominal section of a loadbearing wall is the distance between vertical structural 

members that act as horizontal support, however at most 2.25H, where H is the storey 

height in metres. 

Instruction 

Design of alternative load transfer routes 

Alternative load transfer routes are designed for the design loads of an accidental situation. 

In  the  design  of  an  alternative  load  transfer  route,    it  is  thought  that  a  column,  a  joist 

supporting a column, a joint between a column and a joist, or a section of a loadbearing wall 

pursuant to the definition of clause 3 in the instruction concerning tying systems (one at a 

time on each floor of the building) is removed from the building.  

Instruction 

Definition of key components of building structure 

The vertical structures of the building shall mainly be designed as nonkey components of 

building structure. The procedure for a key component may only be used if an alternative 

load transfer route cannot be formed. Typically, such places may be columns located at the 

outer  corners  of the  building,  for  example.  Not  all  vertical  structures  in  a  building  can  be 

considered key components of building structure. 

A  key  component  of  building  structure  is  tied  to  a  horizontal  structure  in  a  manner 

corresponding  to  the  accidental  action  Ad  in  order  to  allow  the  horizontal  structure  to 

transfer the force to the bracing structures. 

When assessing the force transferred through the components, the ultimate strength of the 

components and their fastenings is taken into account. 

7.  Principles for ensuring the robustness of a halltype building 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 7 Principles for ensuring the robustness of a halltype building 

Sufficient robustness of a halltype building, in accordance with clause 3.3(2), Note 3 of the standard, shall be ensured so that a 

localised failure does not exceed the limits given in section 4. Localised failure is limited by means of structural measures.  

For buildings in consequences class CC3b, a systematic risk assessment of the building should be undertaken, thereby taking into 

account both foreseeable and unforeseeable hazards. If accidental actions can be specified by risk assessment, they shall be taken 

into consideration. Accidental actions include linear loads, concentrated loads, weight loads, deformations or deformation forces.  

Instruction 

Localised damage can be limited by means of one of the following actions: 

  designing alternative load transfer routes 

  increasing the static indeterminacy of the structure and ensuring the toughness  

of the structural joints  

  by using a sufficient number of bracing structures on the roofs and walls 

  by ensuring that the stability of the main supports is retained even after localised 

damage 

  by designing secondary structures in a manner that prevents them from expanding the 

collapsed area  

Impact on supporting substructures 

Ministry of the Environment Decree (10/16) 

concerning national choices for accidental actions, when applying standard SFSEN 199117 

Section 8 Impact on supporting substructures 

 The values given in Table 1 for actions due to impact shall be complied with, in accordance with clause 4.3.1(1) of the 

standard. The values given in the table do not apply to areas that are not accessible to vehicles. 

 The design forces for building structures given in Table 1 for the category of traffic may be multiplied by a reduction 

factor taken from Figure 1 as a function of distance d and the maximum permitted speed of the vehicle 0, provided that 

the maximum speed limit is less than 80 km/h. Distance d is measured from the structural member to the centreline of 

the  nearest  trafficked  lane.  The  design  forces  shall  meet,  at  the  least,  the  requirements  for  the  category  of  traffic 

courtyards and parking garages in Table 1. The values for the reduction factors for speeds between 40 km/h and 80 km/h 

can be obtained by linear interpolation. The reduction factors given in Figure 1 can be applied when the downward slope 

between the centreline of the nearest trafficked lane and the point of impact, measured perpendicularly to the lane, is 

no more than 1:5. The effect of slopes steeper than this and the effect of upward slopes, as well as the effect of rails and 

other measures to avoid impact, shall be specified for the individual project, in accordance with clause 4.3.1(1), Note 2 

of the standard.

factors of crane actions. The values are also used when designing crane supporting 

structures. For structural fire design, only the permanent crane actions are taken into 

account. It is not necessary to dimension crane runways for fire actions, unless otherwise 

stated in project specifications. In the project specification, special attention shall be paid 

to the rescue routes and attack routes for the fire brigade, for which the crane runway may 

have to be locally dimensioned for fire actions.
