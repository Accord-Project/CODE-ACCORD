Section 8 

Calculation method requirements 

Calculations shall take place using a calculation method taking at least the following factors 

into account: 

a)  the  thermal  characteristics  of  building  elements  and  their  connections,  the  building’s 

airtightness, ventilation air flow; 

b) indoor air temperature; 
c) the demand for domestic hot water; 
d) ventilation heat recovery; 
e)  the  thermal  loads  from  humans,  lighting,  electrical  appliances,  domestic  hot  water  and 

sunlight; 

f) the heat and electrical energy demand of the space and ventilation heating system; 
g) the heat and electrical energy demand of the domestic hot water preparation system; 
h) the electrical energy demand of the ventilation system; 
i) the electrical energy demand of consumer equipment and lighting. 
And  where  the  building  is  designed  have  a  solar  collector,  solar  panel  or  drainwater  heat 

recovery: 

j) the heat output of the solar collector and its utilisation in the building; 
k) the electricity output of the solar panel and its utilisation in the building; 
l) drainwater heat recovery and its utilisation in the building. 
The  building’s  calculated  consumption  of  delivered  energy  may  be  calculated  using  the 
monthly calculation method for buildings the indoor air temperature control of which does not 
require cooling or where cooling is only required for spaces the net heated area of which is 
less than 10% of the building’s net heated area or the net heated area of which is less than 50 
m2. 

If  the  building’s  indoor  air  temperature  control  requires  cooling,  the  building’s  calculated 
consumption  of  delivered  energy  shall  be  calculated  using  a  calculation  method  that,  in 
addition to the factors specified in subsection 1, also takes into account the cooling system’s 
heat and electrical energy demand and the heat transfer calculations of which take into account 
the  time-dependent  heat  storage  capacity  of  structures  at  time  steps  of  one  hour  at  the 
maximum (dynamic calculation method).  

Section 9 

Weather data 

The E-value shall be calculated in accordance with the weather data for climatic zone I of 

Annex 1.

Extract air flows shall be calculated using values corresponding to outdoor air flows.  
The outdoor air flow used in the calculations for buildings other than those in intended use 

categories 1 and 2 outside the occupancy period shall be at least 0.15 dm3/s per m2. 

For  buildings  of  intended  use  category  2  where  residents  have  the  opportunity  to  control 
supply  and  extract  air  flows  in  a  manner  whereby  these  can  dwelling  unit-specifically  be 
increased by at least 30% and decreased by at least 40% from the air flow rates of the design 
occupancy period, the outdoor air flow rate used for the building may be 0.4 dm3/s per m2. 

For  a  space  of  a  building  equipped  with  demand-controlled  ventilation  controlled  with  a 
building  automation  system  based  on  presence  detection  or  condition  measurement,  an 
outdoor air flow value that is 20% lower may be used or, on the basis of the ventilation design 
plan,  the  relative  impact  of  demand-controlled  ventilation  on  the  outdoor  air  flow  value 
presented in subsection 1 may be determined. In examinations based on a ventilation design 
plan, the ventilation of the space may, however, be reduced in the calculations no further than 
to 0.35 dm3/s per m2 during the building's occupancy period. The entire building’s outdoor air 
flow value may be reduced in the calculations by a proportion corresponding to the impact of 
demand-controlled  ventilation,  taking  into  account  the  ratio  of  the  building  unit  covered  by 
demand-controlled ventilation to the entire building's area. 

Section 11

Instead  of  the  provisions  laid  down  above  in  subsection  1,  the  value  used  for  the  thermal 
load from lighting may be a value in accordance with the lighting design plan if the thermal 
load can be determined from the lighting design plan specifically for each space type on the 
basis of lighting power density and lighting control. The building’s average thermal load from 
lighting is calculated as an average weighted by the areas of the space types. 

The operating time of the ventilation system shall be calculated by adding to the occupancy 
period in accordance with subsection 1 one hour before the start of the occupancy period and 
one hour after the end of the occupancy period. This addition is not made for buildings that are 
in continuous occupancy. 

Section 12 

Standardised use of domestic hot water 

The  following  net  heating  energy  demand  figures  for  each  intended  use  category  per  a

Section 13 

Calculation zones 

The entire building may be calculated as a single calculation zone in the calculation of the 
E-value for a building with a single intended use. When calculating the E-value for a building 
with multiple intended uses, the building shall be divided into calculation zones corresponding 
to the intended uses and occupancy periods. 

Section 14 

Special spaces and certain technical systems  

The  calculation  of  the  E-value  for  a  restaurant,  professional  kitchen,  canteen,  café, 
laboratory or other special space in a building shall, as regards such spaces, take place using 
initial data corresponding to the intended use of the building or building unit. 

Technical systems not specified in this Decree are not taken into account in the calculation 

of the E-value.  

Section 15 

Net heating energy demand 

The  net  heating  energy  demand  for  a  building’s spaces  shall  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of 
conduction loss, leakage air heat loss and the heating of replacement air and supply air in the 
space  to  room  temperature,  less the  impact  of  the  sun  and  internal thermal loads.  Any  solar 
protection  solutions  in  the  building  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  the  calculation  of  solar 
energy gains for the building.  

The net heating energy demand for ventilation shall be calculated on the basis of the heating 

of air after heat recovery to supply air temperature and any heating before heat recovery. 

The  net  heating  energy  demand  for  domestic  hot  water  shall  be  calculated  in  accordance 

with section 12. 

Section 16 

Taking heat loss into account in calculations of E-value 

When calculating the E-value, the heat loss from the building envelope shall be calculated 
on  the  basis  of  the  internal  dimensions  of  the  building  envelope.  Any  thermal  bridges  of 
structures  and  their  connections  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  the  calculations.  Individual 
thermal bridges in the building envelope are not taken into account. 

The impact of the ground and crawl space on heat loss shall be taken into account in heat 

loss calculations. 

Section 17 

Taking leakage air flow into account in calculations of E-value 

When calculating the E-value, the design value shall be used as the air leakage rate figure 
for  the  building  envelope  if  airtightness  is  proven  by  an  industrial  building  construction 
quality assurance procedure or will be proven by measurements. In other cases, the value of 4 
m3/(h m2) shall be used as the air leakage rate figure for the building envelope.  

Leakage air flow qv,leakage air shall be calculated using the formula:

Avaippa is the area of the building envelope, m2; 
x is a factor which for single-storey buildings is 35, for two-storey buildings is 24, for three- 

and four-storey buildings is 20 and for buildings taller than these is 15; 

3600 is a factor converting the air flow from m3/h to m3/s. 

Section 18 

Energy use of heating systems 

The energy use of a building’s heating system comprises the energy use for space heating, 

ventilation heating and domestic hot water preparation.  

Heat  distribution  losses  inside  and  outside  the  building,  heat  emission  losses,  losses  and 
conversions  in  heating  energy  production,  losses  in  domestic  hot  water  transmission  and 
circulation piping inside and outside the building, storage losses and electricity consumption 
of  the  auxiliary  units  of  the  heating  system  are  taken  into  account  in  the  calculation  of  the 
energy consumption of a heating system. 

If  the  building  is  connected  to  a  heating  system  where  heat  is  conveyed  via  heat  pipes 
external  to  the  building  from  a  shared  heat  exchanger  or  heat  generation  unit  to  several 
buildings, the heat loss from those pipes shall be divided between the buildings in proportion 
to their areas.  

If, in a building of intended use category 2, the habitable rooms have hydronic heating and 
the wet spaces have electric underfloor heating, 35% of the net heating energy demand for the 
spaces  in  a  dwelling  unit  may  be  calculated  to  arise  from  the  underfloor  heating  of  the  wet 
spaces  and  65%  from  the  heating  system  of  the  habitable  rooms,  unless  the  share  of  the 
electric  underfloor  heating  of  the  wet  spaces  of  the  net  demand  of  the  spaces  is  calculated 
more specifically with a dynamic calculation tool taking into account the designed air flows 
and  transfer  air  flows  between  spaces.  The  indoor  temperature  used  for  wet  spaces  shall  be 
+22 °C.  The  share  of  the  electric  underfloor  heating  of  the  wet  spaces  of  the  net  heating 
energy demand of the spaces of a dwelling unit is, however, at most a share calculated on the 
basis of the installed output of the electric underfloor heating presented in the design plan and 
using an operating time of 8,760 hours. 

If  the  domestic  hot  water  circulation  piping  is  located  outside  the  building  envelope 
insulation, no thermal load is created for the building’s spaces from the calculated heat loss of 
domestic  hot  water  circulation.  If  the  circulation  piping  is  located  inside  the  building 
envelope’s insulation, 25% of the calculated domestic hot water circulation heat loss shall be 
added  to  the  thermal  load  of  the  spaces  of  the  building.  If  the  circulation  piping  is  located 
inside the building envelope, 50% of the calculated domestic hot water circulation heat loss 
shall  be  added  to  the  thermal  load  of  the  spaces  of  the  building.  If  the  domestic  hot  water 
cylinder  is  located  inside  the  building  envelope,  50%  of  the  calculated  domestic  hot  water 
cylinder heat loss shall be added to the thermal load of the spaces of the building.  

Supplementary  heating  energy  resulting  from  any  temperature  restrictions  and  part-load 

sizing shall be included in the heating system’s energy consumption in the calculations. 

Section 19 

Fuel-fired appliances and air-source heat pumps 

A maximum of 3,000 kilowatt hours per appliance per year may be calculated as the heating 

energy produced by heat-storing fuel-fired appliances for a dwelling unit.  

A  maximum  of  3,000  kilowatt  hours  per  pump  per  year  may  be  calculated  as  the  heating 
energy  produced  by  air-source  heat  pumps  for  a  dwelling  unit,  unless  the  operation  of  the 
pump in the building is calculated more specifically with a dynamic calculation method taking 
into account the air flows and temperature differences between the spaces.

Ventilation systems 

The air flows and operating times of a building’s ventilation system shall be calculated in 
accordance  with  sections  10  and  11.  The  electrical  energy  consumption  of  a  mechanical 
ventilation  system  shall  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  air  flows,  specific  fan  powers  and 
operating times for all air handling units and powered roof ventilators in the building.  

Section 21 

Cooling systems 

When  calculating  the  energy  consumption  of  a  building’s  cooling  system,  the  energy 
consumption of cooling energy production and the electrical energy consumption of auxiliary 
units  shall  be  taken  into  account  where  the  use  of  the  systems  is  required  for  indoor 
temperature control.  

Section 22 

Electricity use for lighting and consumer equipment 

The annual consumption of electrical energy for lighting and consumer equipment used in 
the building shall be calculated in accordance with section 11 on the basis of the thermal load 
of  these.  The  electrical  energy  consumption  of  lighting  and  consumer  equipment  equals  the 
thermal load of these.

Building heat loss 

Section 23 

Determination of building heat loss 

The  heat  loss  of  a  building  is  the  total  combined  heat  losses  from  the  building  envelope, 
leakage air and ventilation. A building’s heat loss may at most equal the reference heat loss 
determined  for  the  building  on  the  basis  of  reference  values.  The  requirement  set  for  a 
building’s heat loss applies separately to the building’s warm and semi-warm spaces.  

As  regards  building  heat  loss,  only  the  requirements  set  for  heat  loss  from  the  building 
envelope  apply  to  an  extension  of  a  building  or  an  increase  of  gross  floor  area  where  the 
existing ventilation or heating system can be used for the provision of ventilation or heating. 
As  regards  building  heat  loss,  only  the  requirements  set  for  heat  loss  from  the  building 
envelope apply to a detached or semi-detached house designed for use as a holiday dwelling 
for at least four months per year. The requirement set for building heat loss does not apply to a 
portable  building  composed  of  parts  made  before  1 July  2012  that  is  still  used for  the same 
intended purpose.  

Section 24 

Building envelope heat loss 

Heat  loss  from  the  building  envelope  shall  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  areas  and 
thermal  transmittance  coefficients  of  the  various  building  elements  using  the  following

Calculating heat loss from leakage air of buildings  

The leakage air heat loss from a building shall be calculated using the following formula: 

H

vuotoilma

ρ=

piqci

v,

 vuotoilma

where:  
Hvuotoilma is the leakage air heat loss, W/K; 
ρi is the density of air, 1.2 kg/m³; 
cpa is the specific heat capacity of air, 1,000 Ws/(kg K); 
qv,vuotoilma is the leakage air flow, m³/s. 
The  leakage  air  flow  qv,vuotoilma  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  section  17.  When 
calculating the reference heat loss of a building, the value of 2.0 m3/(h m2) shall be used as the 
reference value for the air leakage rate figure for the building envelope. 

When  calculating  the  heat  loss  for  a  building’s  design  solution,  the  design  value  shall  be 
used as the value of the air leakage rate figure for the building envelope. If the achievement of 
the design value for airtightness is not proven with measurements or by an industrial building 
construction quality assurance procedure, the value used as the air leakage rate figure shall be 
4.0 m3/(h m2). 

Section 26 

Calculating heat loss from building ventilation  

The  leakage  air  heat  loss  from  the  ventilation  of  a  building  shall  be  calculated  using  the 

following formula:

where:  
Hiv is the specific heat loss from ventilation, W/K; 
ρi is the density of air, 1.2 kg/m³; 
cpi is the specific heat capacity of air, 1,000 Ws/(kg K); 
qv,poisto is the calculated extract air flow in accordance with standardised use, m³/s; 
td is the ventilation system’s mean daily operating time ratio, h/24 h; 
tw is the ventilation system’s weekly operating time ratio, 24 h/7 days; 
ηa is the annual efficiency of heat recovery from ventilation extract air. 
The  same  air  flow  values  and  operating  times  shall  be  used  for  the  calculations  of  the 

reference heat loss from ventilation and the design solution’s heat loss from ventilation.  

The  ventilation  air  flow  shall  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  section  10.  Demand-
controlled  ventilation  is  not  taken  into  account  when  calculating  reference  heat  losses  and 
design solution heat losses. The ventilation operating time shall be calculated by adding one 
hour before and one hour after the building’s occupancy period in accordance with section 11. 
This  addition  is  not  made  for  buildings  that  are  in  continuous  occupancy.  For  buildings  of 
intended use category 9, the building’s design values shall be used as air flows and ventilation 
operating time. 

In reference heat loss calculations, the value used as the annual efficiency of heat recovery 
from ventilation extract air of the building’s ventilation system shall be 55%. In a building’s 
reference  heat  loss  calculations,  the  value  of  the  annual  efficiency  of  heat  recovery  from 
ventilation extract air of an individual space is 0% if the impurity of extract air prevents the 
functioning of heat recovery, the temperature of the space during the heating season is below 
+10 °C and no heat is recoverable cost-effectively from extract air or if the functioning of the 
ventilation system is based on pressure differences caused mainly by differences in height and 
temperature and the action of the wind. 

If mechanical ventilation is used, the annual efficiency of the extract air heat recovery of the 
air handling unit shall be determined by using the heat recovery equipment’s properties and 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  design  air  flows  of  the  air  handling  unit  as  well  as  weather  data  for  climatic  zone  I 
provided in Annex 1.  

The annual efficiency of the extract air heat recovery of two or more air handling units shall 
be determined as the weighted annual efficiency of the design air flows and operating times. 
The heat loss from ventilation for the building’s design solution shall be calculated by using 
the  annual  efficiency  of  the  extract  air  heat  recovery  determined  in  this  manner  and  the  air 
flow values and operating times in accordance with subsection 3. 

Chapter 4

calculations for the various space types. With the exception of air flow, the initial data used in 
the calculations  shall  be in  accordance  with  the  calculation of the  E-value. The requirement 
laid  down  for  the  room  temperature  for  the  summer  season  does  not  apply  to  buildings  of
