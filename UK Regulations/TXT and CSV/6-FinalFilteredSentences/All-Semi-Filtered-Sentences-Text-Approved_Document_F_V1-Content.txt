The fan should be set at a speed that will approximately achieve the desired continuous flow rate.
The index terminal flow rate should be set with the terminal fully open and all other terminals should be adjusted to achieve the required flows at each terminal.

Ventilation The supply and removal of air (by natural and/or mechanical means) to and from a space or spaces in a building.
This ratio, in steadystate conditions, is numerically equal to the equilibrium relative humidity of the air, except that the latter is commonly expressed as a percentage.
Performance criteria for dwellings.
B2  The performance criterion for moisture is that there should be no visible mould on the inner surfaces of the external walls of a properly heated dwelling with typical moisture generation.
B3  Mould can grow whether the dwelling is occupied or unoccupied, so the performance criterion for humidity (given in Table B3) should be met at all times, regardless of whether there are occupants.
Even if the designer and builder choose to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC)  levels in dwellings by controlling them at source, the ventilation requirements must still be met.
Public Health Englands Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK should be used.
For the purposes of this approved document, for all dwellings (both new and existing, where Part F applies), the moisture criteria are likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average surface water activity of the internal surfaces of external walls is always less than the value in Table B2, evaluated over each moving average period.
B11  For new dwellings, for the purposes of this approved document, the moisture criteria in Table B2 is likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average relative humidity in a room is always less than the value given in Table B3, evaluated over each moving average period.
Checking design air flow rates against measured air  flow rates.
C2  Measured air flow rates for all fans should be recorded on Part 3: Commissioning details, as part of the commissioning procedures given in Section 4 of this approved document.
The measured values should be compared with their respective design values to determine the following.
If the measured rate for each fan is equal to or greater than the design value, then the system meets the design standard.
If any measured value is lower than the design value, an adjustment should be made to correct the system.
If necessary, further adjustments should be made until all air flows match their design values.
Demonstrating compliance.
C3  All three parts of the installation and commissioning checklist should be completed.
The relevant sections of Parts 2 and 3 should be signed by a person who is both competent to install the system and responsible for installing and commissioning the system.
C4  The threepart form should be completed for each installation address.
A copy should be submitted to the building control body as evidence that the system has been correctly installed, inspected and commissioned.
The relevant section of this checklist should be selected depending on the ventilation strategy selected.
NOTE: Although it may go beyond the standards of paragraph 3.6, following the checklist in Table D1 is considered to be an adequate means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum standards of requirement F1(1) as described in paragraph 3.6.
