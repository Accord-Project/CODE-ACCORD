Design and installation P1

Section 1: Design and installation

General

1.1  Electrical installations should be designed and installed in accordance with BS 7671:2008 

incorporating Amendment No 1:2011.
Provision of information

1.2  Sufficient information should be provided to ensure that people can operate, maintain or alter an 

electrical installation with reasonable safety.
The information should comprise items listed in BS 7671 and other appropriate information 

including:

a.  electrical installation certificates or reports describing the installation and giving details of the 

work carried out

b.  permanent labels, for example on earth connections and bonds, and on items of electrical 

equipment such as consumer units and residual current devices (RCDs)

c.  operating instructions and logbooks

d.  for unusually large or complex installations only, detailed plans.
Functionality requirements

1.3  Part P of the Building Regulations covers the safety of electrical installation work; it does not 

cover system functionality.
Other parts of the Building Regulations and other legislation cover the 

functionality of electrically powered products such as fire alarm systems, fans and pumps.
New dwellings

1.4  Wallmounted socketoutlets, switches and consumer units in new dwellings should be easy to 

reach, in accordance with Part M of the Building Regulations (Access to and use of buildings).
NOTE: Approved Document M recommends that in new dwellings only, switches and socket

outlets for lighting and other equipment should be between 450mm and 1200mm from finished 

floor level.
Approved Document M does not recommend a height for new consumer units.
However, one way of complying with Part M in new dwellings is to mount consumer units so that 

the switches are between 1350mm and 1450mm above floor level.
At this height, the consumer unit 

is out of reach of young children yet accessible to other people when standing or sitting.
New dwellings formed by a change of use

1.5  Where a material change of use creates a new dwelling, or changes the number of dwellings in a 

building, regulation 6 requires that any necessary work is carried out to ensure that the building 

complies with requirement P1.
This means that in some cases the existing electrical installation will 

need to be upgraded to meet current standards.
NOTE: If existing cables are adequate, it is not necessary to replace them, even if they use old 

colour codes.

Additions and alterations to existing electrical installations

1.6  Regulation 4(3) states that when building work is complete, the building should be no more 

unsatisfactory in terms of complying with the applicable parts of Schedule 1 to the Building 

Regulations than before the building work was started.
Therefore, when extending or altering an 

electrical installation, only the new work must meet current standards.
There is no obligation to 

upgrade the existing installation unless either of the following applies.
a.
The new work adversely affects the safety of the existing installation.
b.
The state of the existing installation is such that the new work cannot be operated safely.
1.7  Any new work should be carried out in accordance with BS 7671.
The existing electrical installation 

should be checked to ensure that the following conditions are all satisfied.
a.
The rating and condition of existing equipment belonging to both the consumer and to the 

electricity distributor are suitable for the equipment to carry the additional loads arising from 

the new work.
b.
Adequate protective measures are used.
c.  The earthing and equipotential bonding arrangements are satisfactory.

Application of Part P

Section 2: Application of Part P

General

2.1  All electrical installation work carried out in a dwelling is subject to requirement P1, and should 

comply with the design and installation guidance in Section 1.
Section 2 sets out:

a.  the types of building and electrical installation that are within the scope of Part P

b.  the types of electrical work that are notifiable and must be certified as complying with the 

Building Regulations.
Certification procedures are set out in Section 3.
Scope

2.2  Part P applies to electrical installations:

in a dwellinghouse or flat, and to parts of the installation that are:

(i)  outside the dwelling  for example fixed lighting and air conditioning units attached to 

outside walls, photovoltaic panels on roofs, and fixed lighting and pond pumps in gardens

(ii) 

in outbuildings such as sheds, detached garages and domestic greenhouses.
b.  in the common access areas of blocks of flats such as corridors and staircases

in shared amenities of blocks of flats such as laundries, kitchens and gymnasiums

d.  in business premises (other than agricultural buildings) connected to the same meter as the 

electrical installation in a dwelling  for example shops and public houses below flats.
2.3  Part P does not apply to electrical installations:

in business premises in the same building as a dwelling but with separate metering

b.  that supply the power for lifts in blocks of flats (but Part P does apply to lift installations in

Certification, inspection and testing P1

Section 3: Certification, inspection and testing 

General

3.1  For notifiable electrical installation work, one of the following three procedures must be used to 

certify that the work complies with the requirements set out in the Building Regulations.
a.  Selfcertification by a registered competent person.
b.  Thirdparty certification by a registered thirdparty certifier.
c.  Certification by a building control body.
3.2  To verify that the design and installation of electrical work is adequate, and that installations will be 

safe to use, maintain and alter, the electrical work should be inspected and tested in accordance 

with the procedures in BS 7671.
NOTE: Electrical inspection and test forms should be given to the person ordering the work.
Building Regulations certificates should normally be given to the occupier, but in the case of rented 

properties may be given to the person ordering the work and copied to the occupier.
Selfcertification by a registered competent person

3.3  Electrical installers who are registered competent persons should complete a BS 7671 electrical 

installation certificate for every job they undertake.
The electrical installer should give the 

certificate to the person ordering the work.
3.4  The installer or the installers registration body must within 30 days of the work being completed 

do both of the following.
a.
Give a copy of the Building Regulations compliance certificate to the occupier.
b.
Give the certificate, or a copy of the information on the certificate, to the building control 

body.
Certification by a registered third party 

3.5  Before work begins, an installer who is not a registered competent person may appoint a registered 

thirdparty certifier to inspect and test the work as necessary.
3.6  Within 5 days of completing the work, the installer must notify the registered thirdparty certifier 

who, subject to the results of the inspection and testing being satisfactory, should then complete 

an electrical installation condition report and give it to the person ordering the work.
NOTE: The electrical installation condition report should be the model BS 7671 form or one 

developed specifically for Part P purposes.
3.7  The registration body of the thirdparty certifier must within 30 days of a satisfactory condition 

report being issued do both of the following.
a.
Give a copy of the Building Regulations compliance certificate to the occupier.
b.
Give the certificate, or a copy of the information on the certificate, to the building control 

body.

Certification, inspection and testing



Certification by a building control body

If an installer is not a registered competent person and has not appointed a registered thirdparty 

certifier, then before work begins the installer must notify a building control body.
3.9  The building control body will determine the extent of inspection and testing needed for it to 

establish that the work is safe, based on the nature of the electrical work and the competence 

of the installer.
The building control body may choose to carry out any necessary inspection and 

testing itself, or it may contract a specialist to carry out some or all of the work and furnish it with 

an electrical installation condition report.
3.10  An installer who is competent to carry out inspection and testing should give the appropriate  

BS 7671 certificate to the building control body, who will then take the certificate and the installers 

qualifications into account in deciding what further action, if any, it needs to take.
Building control 

bodies may ask installers for evidence of their qualifications.
3.11  This can result in a lower building control charge as, when setting its charge, a local authority is 

required by the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 2010 to take account of the amount 

of inspection work that it considers it will need to carry out.
3.12  Once the building control body has decided that, as far as can be ascertained, the work meets all 

Building Regulations requirements, it will issue to the occupier a Building Regulations completion 

certificate (if a local authority) or a final certificate (if an approved inspector).
Inspection and testing of nonnotifiable work

3.13  Nonnotifiable electrical installation work, like notifiable work, should be designed and installed, and 

inspected, tested and certificated in accordance with BS 7671.
3.14  If local authorities find that nonnotifiable work is unsafe and noncompliant, they can take 

enforcement action.
