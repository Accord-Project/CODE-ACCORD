This  deals with the following

Requirements which are contained in the Building

Regulations 2010.
Loading

A1.
(1) The building shall be constructed so that the combined dead,

imposed and wind loads are sustained and transmitted by it to the

ground:

(a) safely; and

(b) without causing such deflection or deformation of any

part of the building, or such movement of the ground, as will impair

the stability of any part of another building.
(2) In assessing whether a building complies with subparagraph

(1) regard shall be had to the imposed and wind loads to which it is

likely to be subjected in the ordinary course of its use for the purpose

for which it is intended.
Ground movement

A2.
The building shall be constructed so that ground movement

caused by:

(a) swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil; or

(b) landslip or subsidence (other than subsidence arising

from shrinkage), in so far as the risk can be reasonably foreseen,

will not impair the stability of any part of the building.
Introduction

0.1 In the Secretary of States view the

requirements of A1 and A2 will be met by

following the recommendations given in the

documents listed in Section 1 or by adopting

the guidance in Sections 24:

a.
Section 1 is relevant to all building types

and lists Codes, Standards and other

references for structural design and

construction but, where they do not give

precise guidance, consideration should

be given to paragraph 0.2.

b.
Section 2 give sizes of structural elements

for certain residential buildings and other

small buildings of traditional construction.
c. Section 3 gives guidance on the support

and fixing of wall cladding.
d. Section 4 gives guidance where roofs are

to be recovered as a material alteration as

defined in the Regulations.
0.2 The safety of a structure depends on the

successful combination of design and completed

construction, particularly:

a.
The design should be based on identification

of the hazards to which the structure is likely

to be subjected and assessment of the risks.
The selection of relevant critical situations

for design should be made reflecting the

conditions that can reasonably be foreseen

during future use.
b. Loading.
Dead load, imposed load and wind

load should be in accordance with the current

Codes of practice referred to in Section 1 of

this document.
c. Properties of materials.
d. Detailed design and assembly of

the structure.
e. Safety factors.
f. Workmanship.
The numeric values of safety factors, whether

expressed explicitly or implicitly in design

equations, or design values, should be derived

from considerations of the above aspects of

design and construction as a whole.
A change in

any one of these aspects may disturb the safety

of the structure.
Loads used in calculations should allow for

possible dynamic, concentrated and peak load

effects that may occur.
0.3 Grandstands and structures erected in

places of public assembly may need to sustain the

synchronous or rhythmic movement of numbers

of people.
It is important to ensure that the design

of the structure takes these factors into account

so as to avoid the structure being impaired or

causing alarm to people using the structure.
Guidance on the design and testing of

grandstands may be found in Dynamic

performance requirements for permanent

grandstands subject to crowd action

and assessment published by The Institution of

Structural Engineers, December 2008.

Ground movement

(Requirement A2b)

1.11 There may be known or recorded

conditions of ground instability, such as that

arising from landslides, disused mines or

unstable strata which, if ignored, can have a

devastating effect on the safety of a building

and its environs.
Such conditions should be

taken into account in the design of the building

and its foundations.
Attention is drawn to DOE

Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 Development

on unstable land (obtainable from The Stationery

Office), which sets out the broad planning and

technical issues relating to development on

unstable land.
The Department has also sponsored a series

of reviews aimed at determining the scale and

nature of problems arising from mining instability,

natural underground cavities and adverse

foundation conditions.

1.12 Compliance with Part A (Structure) is

required in certain classes of change of use of a

building, subject to the control of Regulations 5

and 6.
Guidance relevant to structural appraisals

related to change of use is given in the following

documents:

a. BRE Digest 366: Structural Appraisal of

Existing Buildings, Including for a Material

Change of Use, 2012

b.

Structures (third edition), 2010

Note: With reference to design checks in the

referenced Institution of Structural Engineers

Technical Publication the choice of various partial

factors should be made to suit the individual

circumstances of each case.
Section 2: Sizes of structural elements for

certain residential buildings and other small

buildings of traditional construction

General

2.1 This section is presented as follows:

Section 2A

Basic requirements for stability.
Section 2B

Sizes of certain timber members in floors and

roofs for dwellings.
Areas at risk from house longhorn beetle.
Section 2C

Thickness of masonry walls in certain residential

buildings of not more than three storeys, small

singlestorey nonresidential buildings and annexes.
Section 2D

Proportions for masonry chimneys.
Section 2E

Foundations of plain concrete.
2.2 Section 2A gives general rules which must

be observed in following Sections 2B and 2C.
Sections 2B to 2E may be used independently

of each other.
Throughout this section the diagrams are only

illustrative and do not show all the details of

construction.
Definitions

2.3 The following meanings apply to terms

throughout this section:

Buttressing wall A wall designed and

constructed to afford lateral support to another

wall perpendicular to it, support being provided

from the base to the top of the wall.
Cavity width The horizontal distance between

the two leaves of a cavity wall.
Compartment wall A wall constructed as a

compartment wall to meet the requirements of

regulation B3(2).
Dead load The load due to the weight of

all walls, permanent partitions, floors, roofs

and finishes including services, and all other

permanent construction.
Imposed load The load assumed to be produced

by the intended occupancy or use, including

the weight of movable partitions, distributed,

concentrated, impact, inertia and snow loads,

but excluding wind loads.
Pier A member which forms an integral part

of a wall, in the form of a thickened section at

intervals along the wall, so as to afford lateral

support to the wall to which it is bonded or

securely tied.
Separating wall A wall or part of a wall which is

common to adjoining buildings, and constructed

to meet the requirements of regulation B3(2).
Spacing The distance between the longitudinal

centres of any two adjacent timber members of

the same type, measured in the plane of floor,

ceiling or roof structure.
Span The distance measured along the centre

line of a member between the centres of any two

adjacent bearings or supports.
Supported wall A wall to which lateral support is

afforded by a combination of buttressing walls,

piers or chimneys acting in conjunction with

floor(s) or roof.
Wind load The load due to the effect of wind

pressure or suction.
Section 2A: Basic requirements for stability

2A1 This section must be used in conjunction

with sections 2B and 2C and its principles relate

to all forms of lowrise residential buildings.
2A2 Adequate provision shall be made to

ensure that the building is stable under the likely

imposed and wind loading conditions.
This will

commonly necessitate meeting the following

requirements:

a.
That the overall size and proportioning

of the building are limited in accordance

with the specific guidance for each form of

construction.
b.
That a suitable layout of walls (both internal

and external) forming a robust 3 dimensional

box structure in plan is constructed with

restriction on the maximum size of cells

measured in accordance with the specific

guidance for each form of construction.
c. That the internal and external walls are

adequately connected either by masonry

bonding or by using mechanical connections.
d. That the intermediate floors and roof are of

such construction and interconnection with

the walls that they provide local support

to the walls and also act as horizontal

diaphragms capable of transferring the wind

forces to buttressing elements of the building.
Note: A traditional cut timber roof (i.e.
using

rafters, purlins and ceiling joists) generally has

sufficient built in resistance to instability and wind

forces (e.g.
from hipped ends, tiling battens, rigid

sarking or the like).
However, the need for

diagonal rafter bracing equivalent to that

recommended in BS EN 199511:2004 with its

UK National Annex and additional guidance given

in BSI Published Document PD 66931:2012 and

BS 81033:2009 for trussed rafter roofs should

be considered, especially for singlehipped and

nonhipped roofs of greater than 40 pitch to

detached houses.
Section 2B: Sizes of certain timber members

in floors and roofs for dwellings.
Areas at

risk from house longhorn beetle

Sizing of members

2B1 Guidance on the sizing of certain members

in floors and roofs is given in Span tables for

solid timber members in floors, ceilings and roofs

(excluding trussed rafter roofs) for dwellings,

published by TRADA, available from Chiltern

House, Stocking Lane, Hughenden Valley, High

Wycombe, Bucks HP14 4ND.
Alternative guidance is available in BS EN 1995

11:2004 Design of timber structures with its UK

National Annex and additional guidance given in

BSI Published Document PD 66931:2012 and

also BS 81033:2009 Structural design of lowrise buildings, Code of practice for timber floors

and roofs for housing.
House longhorn beetle

2B2 In the geographical areas specified in

Table 1, softwood timber for roof construction

or fixed in the roof space, including ceiling joists

within the void spaces of the roof, should be

adequately treated to prevent infestation by the

house longhorn beetle (Hylotrupes bajulus L.).
Guidance on suitable preservative treatments

is given within The Wood Protection Associations

manual Industrial Wood Preservation:

Specification and Practice (2012), available

from 5C Flemming Court, Castleford,

West Yorkshire, WF10 5HW.
Section 2C: Thickness of walls in certain

small buildings

Application

2C1 This section applies to the following

building types:

a. residential buildings of not more than

three storeys;

b. small singlestorey nonresidential

buildings;

c. small buildings forming annexes to

residential buildings (including garages

and outbuildings).
Wall types

2C2 Only the types of wall given in Table 2,

which must extend to the full storey height, and

parapet walls are considered in this section.
The use of this section

2C3 When using this section it should be

noted that:

a. this section must be used in conjunction

with section 2A;

b. if wall thickness is to be determined

according to paragraphs 2C5 to 2C13, all

appropriate design conditions given in this

section must be satisfied;

c. walls should comply with the relevant

requirements of BS EN 19962:2006 with its

UK National Annex and additional guidance

given in BSI Published Document PD

6697:2010, except as regards the conditions

given in paragraphs 2C4 and 2C14 to 2C38;

d. in formulating the guidance of this section the

worst combination of circumstances likely to

arise was taken into account.
If a requirement

of this part is considered too onerous in a

particular case it may be appropriate to

consider a minor departure on the basis

of judgement and experience, or to show

adequacy by calculation in respect of the

aspect of the wall which is subject to the

departure rather than for the entire wall;

e. the guidance given is based upon the

compressive strengths of bricks and blocks

being not less than indicated in Tables 6 and 7.
BS EN 199611:2005 with its UK National

Annex gives design strengths for walls where

the suitability for use of masonry units of other

compressive strengths is being considered.
Conditions relating to the building

of which the wall forms part

2C4 This section applies only to buildings

having proportions within the following

parameters (see Diagrams 1 and 2):

a. residential buildings of not more than

three storeys:

i. the maximum height of the building

measured from the lowest finished ground

level adjoining the building to the highest

point of any wall or roof should not be

greater than 15m, subject to the limits

of paragraph 2C16;

ii.
the height of the building H should not

exceed twice the least width of the

building W1;

iii.
the height of the wing H2 should not

exceed twice the least width of the wing

W2 where the projection P exceeds twice

the width W2;

b. small singlestorey nonresidential buildings:

height H should not exceed 3m and W (being

the greatest length or width of the building)

should not exceed 9m (see Diagram 2),

subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16;

c. annexes: height H as variously indicated in

Diagram 2 should not exceed 3m, subject to

the limits of paragraph 2C16.
Thickness of walls

2C5 General wall thickness may be determined

according to this section provided:

a. conditions relating to the building of which

the wall forms part (see paragraphs 2C4,

2C14 to 2C16, 2C38); and

b. conditions relating to the wall (see paragraphs

2C17 to 2C37) are met.
(See Diagram 3.)
2C6 Solid external walls, compartment walls

and separating walls in coursed brickwork or

blockwork: Solid walls constructed of coursed

brickwork or blockwork should be at least

as thick as 1/16 of the storey height.
Further

requirements are given in Table 3.
2C7 Solid external walls, compartment

walls and separating walls in uncoursed stone,

flints, etc.
: The thickness of walls constructed

in uncoursed stone, flints, clunches, bricks or

other burnt or vitrified material should not be

less than 1.33 times the thickness determined

by paragraph 2C6.
2C8 Cavity walls in coursed brickwork or

blockwork: All cavity walls should have leaves

at least 90mm thick and cavities at least 50mm

wide.
The wall ties should have a horizontal

spacing of 900mm and a vertical spacing of

450mm, or alternatively should be spaced such that the number of wall ties per square metre is

not less than 2.5 ties/m2

.
Wall ties should also be

provided, spaced not more than 300mm apart

vertically, within a distance of 225mm from the

vertical edges of all openings, movement joints

and roof verges.
For selection of wall ties for use

in a range of cavity widths refer to Table 5.
For

specification of cavity wall ties refer to paragraph

2C19.
For external walls, compartment walls and

separating walls in cavity construction, the

combined thickness of the two leaves plus 10mm

should not be less than the thickness determined

by paragraph 2C6 and Table 3 for a solid wall of

the same height and length.
2C9 Walls providing vertical support to

other walls: Irrespective of the material used

in the construction, a wall should not be less in

thickness than any part of the wall to which it

gives vertical support.
2C10 Internal loadbearing walls in brickwork

or blockwork (except compartment walls or

separating walls): All internal loadbearing walls

should have a thickness not less than:

except for a wall in the lowest storey of a three

storey building, carrying load from both upper

storeys, which should have a thickness as

determined by the equation or 140mm whichever

is the greatest.
2C11 Parapet walls: The minimum thickness

and maximum height of parapet walls should be

as given in Diagram 4.
2C12 Single leaves of certain external walls:

The single leaf of external walls of small singlestorey nonresidential buildings and of annexes

need be only 90mm thick, notwithstanding

paragraphs 2C38.
2C13 Modular bricks and blocks: Where walls

are constructed of bricks or blocks having

modular dimensions, wall thicknesses prescribed

in this section which derive from a dimension of

brick or block may be reduced by an amount not

exceeding the deviation from work size permitted

by a British Standard relating to equivalent sized

bricks or blocks made of the same material.
2C14 Maximum floor area: The guidance of

this section assumes that no floor enclosed by

structural walls on all sides exceeds 70m2

, and

that no floor without a structural wall on one side

exceeds 36m2

.
(See Diagram 5.)
2C15 Imposed loads on roofs, floors and

ceilings: The design considerations given in

this section are intended to be adequate for the

imposed loads given in Table 4.
2C16 Maximum height of buildings: The design

guidance in this section is based on BS EN

199114:2005 with its UK National Annex.
The

Long walls may be provided with intermediate

buttressing walls, piers or chimneys dividing

the wall into distinct lengths within each storey;

each distinct length is a supported wall for

the purposes of this section.
The intermediate

buttressing walls, piers or chimneys should

The amount of any projection should not impair

the stability of the wall.
Lateral support by roofs and floors

2C32 A wall in each storey of a building should

extend to the full height of that storey, and have

horizontal lateral supports to restrict movement

of the wall at right angles to its plane.
2C33 Floors and roofs should:

a. act to transfer lateral forces from walls to

buttressing walls, piers or chimneys; and

b. be secured to the supported wall by

connections specified in paragraphs 2C34

and 2C35.
2C34 The requirements for lateral restraint of

walls at roof and floor levels are given in Table 9

and guidance on satisfying the requirements is

given in paragraphs 2C35 and 2C36.
2C35 Walls should be strapped to floors above

ground level, at intervals not exceeding 2m

and as shown in Diagram 15, by tension straps

conforming to BS EN 8451.
For corrosion

resistance purposes, the tension straps should

be material reference 14 or 16.1 or 16.2

(galvanised steel) or other more resistant

specifications including material references 1 or

foundations should be taken to a depth where

anticipated ground movements will not impair

the stability of any part of the building taking due

consideration of the influence of vegetation and

trees on the ground.
The depth to the underside

of foundations on clay soils should not be less

than 0.75m on low shrinkage clay soils, 0.9m on

Section 3: Wall cladding

General

3.1 Wall cladding presents a hazard if it

becomes detached from the building.
This

section provides guidance on the support

and fixing of wall cladding.
An acceptable

level of safety can be achieved by different

means depending on the type and location of

the cladding.
The guidance given relates to

all forms of cladding, including curtain walling

and glass facades.
It is not intended to provide

guidance concerning the weather resistance

of wall cladding which is included in Approved

Document C, Site preparation and resistance

to contaminants and moisture, or guidance on

resistance to spread of fire which is included in

 B, Fire safety, or guidance

in relation to sound insulation, which is included

in  E, Resistance to the

passage of sound.
Technical approach

3.2 The cladding will meet the safety

requirement if:

a. the cladding is capable of safely sustaining

and transmitting to the supporting structure

of the building all dead, imposed and wind

loads, and

b. the cladding is securely fixed to and

supported by the structure of the building.
This shall comprise both vertical support

and horizontal restraint, and

c. provision is made, where necessary, to

accommodate differential movement of the

cladding and the supporting structure of the

building, and

d. the cladding and its fixings (including

any support components) are of durable

materials; the design life of the fixings being

not less than that of the cladding.
Fixings

shall be corrosion resistant and of a material

type appropriate for the local environment.
Loading

3.3 Wind loading on the cladding should be

derived from BS EN 199114:2005 with its UK

National Annex with due consideration given to

local increases in wind suction arising from

funnelling of the wind through gaps between

buildings.
3.4 Where the cladding is required to support

other fixtures, e.g.
handrails, and fittings, e.g.
antennae and signboards, account should be

taken of the loads and forces arising from such

fixtures and fittings.
3.5 Where the wall cladding is required to

function as pedestrian guarding to stairs, ramps,

vertical drops of more than 600mm in dwellings

or more than the height of two risers (or 380mm

if not part of a stair) in other buildings, or as a vehicle barrier, then account should be taken of

the additional imposed loading, as stipulated in

 K, Protection from falling,

collision and impact.
3.6 Where the wall cladding is required to

safely withstand lateral pressures from crowds,

an appropriate design loading is given in BS EN

199111:2002 with its UK National Annex and

the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (4th

Edition, 1997).
Fixings

3.7 The selection of fixings for supporting

cladding should be determined from a

consideration of the proven performance of the

fixing and the risks associated with the particular

application.
In this regard applications should be

designated as being either nonredundant (where

the failure of a single fixing could lead to the

detachment of the cladding) or redundant (where

failure or excessive movement of one fixing

results in load sharing by adjacent fixings) and

the required reliability of the fixing determined

accordingly.
Note: Attention is drawn to the availability of

anchors with an ETA gained in accordance with

the requirements of ETAG 001 Guideline for

European Technical Approval Metal Anchors

for use in Concrete Parts 15, which cover both

redundant and nonredundant applications, and

Part 6 which covers Anchors for multiple use

in nonstructural applications and which can

effectively be regarded as covering redundant

use.
The UK definition of multiple use is

contained in an annexe to ETAG Part 6 and is

framed in such a way that all applications can be

validated as to whether or not they conform to

this category without calculation.
All ETAG parts

may be downloaded in English from www.eota.be.
3.8 The strength of fixings should be derived

from tests using materials representative of the

material into which the fixing is to be anchored,

taking account of any inherent weaknesses that

may affect the strength of the fixing, e.g.
cracks

in concrete due to shrinkage and flexure, or voids

in masonry construction.
The design loads will

generally be available from the manufacturers

test data determined from an ETA or an extant

British Standard.
Note: ETAs are available which cover use either

in both cracked and noncracked concrete or in

noncracked concrete only.
Those which cover

both cracked and noncracked concrete allow

higher loads for use in noncracked than in

cracked concrete.

3.9 The use of large panels of glass in

cladding of walls and roofs where the cladding

is not divided into small areas by loadbearing

framing requires special consideration.

Section 4: Roof covering

Materials

4.1 All materials used to cover roofs, excluding

windows of glass in residential buildings with roof

pitches of not less than 15, shall be capable of

safely withstanding the concentrated imposed

loads upon roofs specified in BS EN 19911

1:2002 with its UK National Annex.
Transparent

or translucent covering materials for roofs not

accessible except for normal maintenance and

repair are excluded from the requirement to

carry the concentrated imposed load upon roofs

if they are nonfragile or are otherwise suitably

protected against collapse.
Recovering of roofs

4.2 The recovering of roofs is commonly

undertaken to extend the useful life of buildings.
Roof structures may be required to carry

underdrawing or insulation provided at a time

later than their initial construction.
This section

provides guidance on determining whether such

work to a roof constitutes a material alteration

under the Building Regulations.
4.3 Where the work involves a significant

change in the applied loading the structural

integrity of the roof structure and the supporting

structure should be checked to ensure that

upon completion of the work the building is not

less compliant with Requirement A1 than the

original building.
4.4 A significant change in roof loading is

when the loading upon the roof is increased by

more than 15.
Consideration might also be

given to whether the roof covering being replaced

is the original asbuilt covering.
4.5 Where such checking of the existing roof

structure indicates that the construction is unable

to sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g.
due to overstressed members or unacceptable

deflection leading to ponding), appropriate

strengthening work or replacement of roofing

members should be undertaken.
This is classified

as a material alteration.
4.6 In carrying out the checks mentioned in

paragraph 4.3 an increase of stress in a structural

member arising from increased loading does

not necessarily indicate that the roof structure is

less compliant than the original roof provided an

adequate factor of safety is maintained.
4.7 Where work will significantly decrease

the roof dead loading, the roof structure and its

anchorage to the supporting structure should

be checked to ensure that an adequate factor

of safety is maintained against uplift of the roof

under imposed wind loading

DISPROPORTIONATE COLLAPSE

The Requirement

This  deals with the following

Requirements which are contained in the Building

Regulations 2010.
Guidance

Performance

In the Secretary of States view the Requirement

of A3 will be met by an appropriate choice

of measures to reduce the sensitivity of a

building to disproportionate collapse should

an accident occur.
Introduction

0.1 The guidance in Section 5 deals with the

means of meeting this performance criterion.
Section 5: Reducing the sensitivity of the

building to disproportionate collapse in the

event of an accident

5.1 The requirement will be met by adopting

the following approach for ensuring that the

building is sufficiently robust to sustain a limited

extent of damage or failure, depending on the

consequence class of the building, without

collapse.
a.
Determine the buildings consequence class

from Table 11.

b.
For Consequence Class 1 buildings 

Provided the building has been designed

and constructed in accordance with the rules

given in this , or other

guidance referenced under Section 1, for

meeting compliance with Requirement A1

and A2 in normal use, no additional measures

are likely to be necessary.
c. For Consequence Class 2a buildings 

In addition to the Consequence Class 1

measures, provide effective horizontal ties,

or effective anchorage of suspended floors

to walls, as described in the Standards listed

under paragraph 5.2 for framed and loadbearing wall construction (the latter being

defined in paragraph 5.3 below).
d. For Consequence Class 2b buildings 

In addition to the Consequence Class 1

measures, provide effective horizontal ties,

as described in the Standards listed under

paragraph 5.2 for framed and loadbearing

wall construction (the latter being defined in

paragraph 5.3 below), together with effective

vertical ties, as defined in the Standards

listed under paragraph 5.2, in all supporting

columns and walls.
Alternatively, check that upon the notional

removal of each supporting column and each

beam supporting one or more columns, or any

nominal length of loadbearing wall (one at a

time in each storey of the building), the building

remains stable and that the area of floor at any

storey at risk of collapse does not exceed 15 of

the floor area of that storey or 100m2

, whichever

is smaller, and does not extend further than the

immediate adjacent storeys (see Diagram 24).
Where the notional removal of such columns

and lengths of walls would result in an extent of

damage in excess of the above limit, then such

elements should be designed as a key element

as defined in paragraph 5.3 below.
e. For Consequence Class 3 buildings  A

systematic risk assessment of the building

should be undertaken taking into account

all the normal hazards that may reasonably

be foreseen, together with any abnormal

hazards.
Critical situations for design should be selected

that reflect the conditions that can reasonably

be foreseen as possible during the life of the

building.
The structural form and concept and

any protective measures should then be chosen

and the detailed design of the structure and its

elements undertaken in accordance with the

recommendations given in the Standards given in

paragraph 5.2.

5.3 Definitions

Nominal length of loadbearing wall

The nominal length of loadbearing wall

construction referred to in 5.1d should be taken

as follows:

 in the case of a reinforced concrete wall, the

distance between lateral supports subject to

a maximum length not exceeding 2.25H,

 in the case of an external masonry wall,

or timber or steel stud wall, the length

measured between vertical lateral supports,

 in the case of an internal masonry wall,

or timber or steel stud wall, a length not

exceeding 2.25H,

where H is the storey height in metres.
Note: Annex A of BS EN 199117:2006 with

its UK National Annex provides corresponding

guidance.
Key elements

A key element, as referred to in paragraph 5.1d,

should be capable of sustaining an accidental

design loading of 34kN/m2

 applied in the

horizontal and vertical directions (in one direction

at a time) to the member and any attached

components (e.g.
cladding etc.)
having regard to

the ultimate strength of such components and

their connections.
Such accidental design loading

should be assumed to act simultaneously with

all other design loadings (i.e.
wind and imposed

loading) in accidental actions loading combination.
REDUCING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE BUILDING TO

DISPROPORTIONATE COLLAPSE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT

BS EN 1990:2002A1:2005 with its UK National

Annex provides guidance on accidental

design loading and accidental actions loading

combination for key elements and expressions

6.11a and 6.11b of that Standard are relevant.
Note: Annex A of BS EN 199117:2006 with

its UK National Annex provides corresponding

guidance for key elements.
Loadbearing construction

For the purposes of this Guidance the term loadbearing wall construction includes masonry

crosswall construction and walls comprising

close centred timber or lightweight steel section

studs.
Alternative approach

5.4 As an alternative to Table 11, for any

building which does not fall into the classes listed

under Table 11, or for which the consequences

of collapse may warrant particular examination

of the risks involved, performance may be

demonstrated using the recommendations given

in the following Reports and Publication:

Guidance on Robustness and Provision against

Accidental Actions, dated July 1999.

Compliance with the requirements of Building

Regulation Part A3.

Seismic design

5.5 Seismic design is not usually required

for buildings classified by Table 11 as being

in Consequence Classes 1, 2a and 2b.
For

buildings classified as Consequence Class 3 the

risk assessment should consider if there is any

need to carry out seismic design, although such

a need is not an explicit requirement for these

buildings.
