Regulation 4 states that building work should be carried out in such a way that, when work is 

complete:

a.  for new buildings or work on a building that complied with the applicable requirements of the 

Building Regulations: the building complies with the applicable requirements of the Building 

Regulations

b.  for work on an existing building that did not comply with the applicable requirements of the 

Building Regulations:

(ii) 

the work itself must comply with the applicable requirements of the Building Regulations

the building must be no more unsatisfactory in relation to the requirements than before 

the work was carried out.


The Building Regulations set out requirements that must be met before a building can be used for a 

new purpose.


Materials and workmanship

In accordance with regulation 7, building work must be carried out in a workmanlike manner using 

adequate and proper materials.

Stairs and ladders K1

 In a flight of steps, for all steps use the measurements for rise and going given for the three stair 

categories in Table 1.1 below.


2   For dwellings, for external tapered steps and stairs that are part of the building the going of each step should be 

a minimum of 280mm.


The normal relationship between the dimensions of the rise and going is: twice the rise plus the going (2R  G) 

equals between 550mm and 700mm.


For existing buildings the dimensional requirements in Table 1.1 should be followed, unless due to dimensional 

constraints it is not possible.


Any alternative proposal should be agreed with the relevant building control body and 

included in an access strategy (refer to Approved Document M).


Stepped gangways in assembly buildings

1.4  The guidance provided in this document covers stairs or ramps that form part of the means of access 

within an assembly building such as a sports stadium, theatre or cinema.


In stepped tiers, use the following measurements for each step in the gangway:

(i)  minimum height: 100mm

(ii)  maximum height: 190mm

If there are two or more rises to each row of seats, make each step an equal height.


In a tier that is uninterrupted by crossgangways, and where the pitch exceeds 25, use a 

maximum number of steps of 40.


j.  Gangways should not be less than 1100mm wide unless used by not more than 50 persons, in 

which case gangways should be a minimum of 900mm.


If the nosing protrudes, 

ensure that this is by no more than 25mm (see Diagram 1.2).


If the soffit beneath a stair is less than 2m above floor level, protect the area beneath a stair with 

one of the following.

smallest width of the flight (see Diagram 1.6).

a. may include part of the floor of the building
