requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the 

Building Regulations shall be carried out in 

accordance with regulation 7.


Dwellinghouses, flats and rooms for residential purposes 

shall  be  designed  and  constructed  in  such  a  way  that  they 

provide reasonable resistance to sound from other parts of the 

same building and from adjoining buildings.


Dwellinghouses, flats and rooms for residential purposes 

shall be designed and constructed in such a way that:

(a)  internal  walls  between  a  bedroom  or  a  room 

containing a water closet, and other rooms; and

(b)  internal floors

provide reasonable resistance to sound.


The  common  internal  parts  of  buildings  which  contain 

flats  or  rooms  for  residential  purposes  shall  be  designed  and 

constructed  in  such  a  way  as  to  prevent  more  reverberation 

around the common parts than is reasonable.

designed and constructed in such a way that it has the acoustic 

conditions  and  the  insulation  against  disturbance  by  noise 

appropriate to its intended use.


(2)  For the purposes of this Part  school has the same 

meaning  as  in  Section  4  of  the  Education Act  19964;  and 

school building means any building forming a school or part 

of a school.


Interpretation (Regulation 2) room for residential 

purposes means a room, or a suite of rooms, which 

is not a dwellinghouse or a flat and which is used 

by one or more persons to live and sleep and 

includes a room in a hostel, an hotel, a boarding 

house, a hall of residence or a residential home, 

but does not include a room in a hospital, 

or other similar establishment, used for patient 

accommodation.


Meaning of material change of use 

(Regulation 5)

For the purposes of paragraph 8 (1)(e) of Schedule 1 

to the Act and for the purposes of these Regulations, 

there is a material change of use where there is 

a change in the purposes for which or the 

circumstances in which a building is used, 

so that after the change:

a.  the building is used as a dwelling, where 

previously it was not;

b.  the building contains a flat, where previously 

it did not;

c.  the building is used as an hotel or boarding 

house, where previously it was not;

d.  the building is used as an institution, where 

previously it was not;

e.  the building is used as a public building, 

where previously it was not;

the building is not a building described 

in Classes 1 to 6 in Schedule 2, where 

previously it was;

g.  the building, which contains at least one 

dwelling, contains a greater or lesser number 

of dwellings than it did previously;

h.  the building contains a room for residential 

purposes, where previously it did not; or

the building, which contains at least one 

room for residential purposes, contains a 

greater or lesser number of such rooms 

than it did previously.

The sound insulation testing should be 

carried out in accordance with the procedure 

described in Annex B of this Approved Document, 

which is the procedure formally approved by the 

Secretary of State for the purpose of paragraph 

(2)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (2)(a) of 

Regulation 20(1) and (5).


The results of the testing 

must be recorded in the manner described in 

paragraph 1.41 of Section 1 of this Approved 

Document, which is the manner approved by the 

Secretary of State for the purposes of paragraph 

(3)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (3)(a) of 

Regulation 20(1) and (5).


The test results must be 

given to the building control body in accordance 

with the time limits set down in Regulation 41 (for 

cases where building control is being done by the 

local authority) or Regulation 20(1) and (5) (in 

cases where it is being done by an Approved 

Inspector).


0.6  Buildings constructed from subassemblies 

that are delivered newly made or selected from 

stock are no different from any other new building 

and must comply with all requirements in Schedule 1 

of the Building Regulations 2010.


The 

need to conserve the special characteristics of 

such historic buildings needs to be recognised1, 

and in such work, the aim should be to improve 

sound insulation to the extent that it is practically 

possible, always provided that the work does not 

prejudice the character of the historic building, or 

increase the risk of longterm deterioration to the 

building fabric or fittings.


BS 7913 The principles of the conservation of historic buildings, 1998 

provides guidance on the principles that should be applied when 

proposing work on historic buildings.


0.13  Diagrams 0.1 to 0.3 illustrate the relevant 

parts of the building that should be protected 

from airborne and impact sound in order to 

satisfy Requirements E1 and E2.

Section 1: Precompletion testing

1.10  Tests should be carried out once the 

dwellinghouses, flats or rooms for residential 

purposes either side of a separating element are 

essentially complete, except for decoration.


Impact 

sound insulation tests should be carried out 

without a soft covering (e.g.


1.12  Grouping should be carried out according 

to the following criteria.


Dwellinghouses (including 

bungalows), flats and rooms for residential purposes 

should be considered as three separate groups.


In addition, if significant differences in construction 

type occur within any of these groups, subgroups 

should be established accordingly.


Subgrouping for new buildings

1.14  For dwellinghouses (including bungalows), 

subgrouping should be by type of separating wall.


For flats, subgrouping should be by type of 

separating floor and type of separating wall.


Rooms 

for residential purposes should be grouped using 

similar principles.


1.17  Some dwellinghouses, flats or rooms for 

residential purposes may be considered to have 

unfavourable features: an example could be flats 

with large areas of flanking wall without a window 

at the gable end.


Sound insulation testing to demonstrate 

compliance with Requirement E1 should be carried 

out on site as part of the construction process, 

and in this Approved Document it is referred to 

as precompletion testing.


Testing should be carried out for:

a.  purpose built dwellinghouses and flats;

b.  dwellinghouses and flats formed by material 

change of use;

c.  purpose built rooms for residential purposes;

d.  rooms for residential purposes formed by 

material change of use.


The performance standards that should be 

demonstrated by precompletion testing are set 

out in Section 0: Performance  Tables 1a and 1b.


Where additional 

guidance is required, specialist advice on the 

building design should be sought at an early stage.


Tests should be carried out between rooms 

or spaces that share a common area of separating 

wall or separating floor.


a bedroom 

and a study, a living room and a bedroom), at 

least one of the rooms in one of the pairs should 

be a bedroom and at least one of the rooms in 

the other pair should be a living room.


Sets of tests in rooms for 

residential purposes

1.27  To conduct a set of tests, the sound 

insulation between the main rooms should be 

measured according to the principles set out in 

this section for new buildings and material change 

of use, but adapting them to suit the circumstances.


Measurements of sound insulation should be 

made between the available spaces, according 

to the principles set out in this section.


Steps 

should be taken to ensure that fitting out will not 

adversely affect the sound insulation.


Therefore if a site comprises 

only one pair of dwellinghouses, flats or rooms 

for residential purposes, they should be tested.


Assuming 

no tests are failed, building control bodies should 

stipulate at least one set of tests for every ten 

dwellinghouses, flats or rooms for residential 

purposes in a group or subgroup.


1.31  Testing should be conducted more frequently 

at the beginning of a series of completions than 

towards the end, to allow any potential problems 

to be addressed at an early stage.


However, on 

large developments testing should be carried out 

over a substantial part of the construction period.


Action following a failed set of tests

1.32  A set of tests is failed if any of its individual 

tests of airborne or impact sound insulation do 

not show sound insulation values equal to or better 

than those set out in Section 0: Performance  

Tables 1a and 1b.


1.33 

In the event of a failed set of tests, 

appropriate remedial treatment should be applied 

to the rooms that failed the test.


Once a dwellinghouse, flat or room for residential 

purposes is occupied, any action affecting it 

should be a matter for local negotiation.


1.36  After a failed set of tests, the rate of testing 

should be increased until the building control body 

is satisfied that the problem has been solved.


Remedial treatment

1.37  Appropriate remedial treatment should be 

applied following a failed set of tests.


1.39  Where remedial treatment has been applied, 

the building control body should be satisfied with 

its efficacy.


However, in 

such cases building control bodies should be 

satisfied that everything reasonable has been 

done to improve the sound insulation.


Tests 

should be carried out, and the results displayed 

as indicated in Section 0, paragraph 0.7.


In order to satisfy the requirements of 

Approved manner of recording 

precompletion testing results

1.41 

paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 41 or Regulation 

20(1) and (5), the test report of a set of tests 

(where set of tests has the meaning given in 

paragraphs 1.191.21 and 1.27) must contain at 

least the following information, in the order below:

1.


A statement (preferably in a table) giving the 

following information:

a.  the rooms used for each test within the 

set of tests;

b.  the measured singlenumber quantity 

(DnT,w  Ctr for airborne sound insulation 

and LnT,w for impact sound insulation) for 

each test within the set of tests;

c.  the sound insulation values that should be 

achieved according to the values set out in 

Section 0: Performance  Table 1a or 1b; and

d.  an entry stating Pass or Fail for each test 

within the set of tests according to the 

sound insulation values set out in Section 

0: Performance  Table 1a or 1b.


If the 

procedure could not be followed exactly 

then the exceptions should be described 

and reasons given;

c.  source and receiver room volumes 

(including a statement on which rooms 

were used as source rooms);

d.  results of tests shown in tabular and 

graphical form for third octave bands 

according to the relevant part of the 

BS EN ISO 140 series and BS EN ISO 717 

series, including:

i.  singlenumber quantities and the 

spectrum adaptation terms;

ii.


Advice should be sought from the 

manufacturer or other appropriate source.


In order for the construction to be fully 

Junctions between separating

effective, care should be taken to correctly detail 

the junctions between the separating wall and other 

elements, such as floors, roofs, external walls and 

internal walls.


2.16  Plasterboard linings should be fixed 

according to manufacturers instructions.


2.21  Measurements of the wall tie dynamic 

stiffness, kXmm, should be carried out according to 

BRE Information Paper, IP 3/01.


If kXmm is not available for the required 

2.23 

cavity width, it is acceptable to use available kXmm 

data for Xmm values less than the required cavity 

width to calculate n.kXmm.


Corridor walls and doors

2.25  The separating walls described in this section 

should be used between corridors and rooms in 

flats, in order to control flanking transmission and 

to provide the required sound insulation.


However, there should be a sufficient number of 

flats that are suitable for disabled access, see 

Building Regulation Part M  Access and facilities 

for disabled people.


Refuse chutes

2.28  A wall separating a habitable room or 

kitchen and a refuse chute should have a mass 

per unit area (including any finishes) of at least 

1320kg/m.


A wall separating a nonhabitable 

room from a refuse chute should have a mass 

per unit area (including any finishes) of at least 

220kg/m.


2.31  Details of how junctions should be made 

to limit flanking transmission are also described 

in this guidance.

The separating wall should be bonded 

to the external wall in such a way that the 

separating wall contributes at least 50 of 

the bond at the junction.


2.38  The masonry inner leaf should have a mass 

per unit area of at least 120kg/m excluding finish.


However, there is no minimum mass requirement 

where there are openings in the external wall 

(see Diagram 2.8) that are:

a.  not less than 1 metre high; and

b.  on both sides of the separating wall at every 

storey; and

c.  not more than 700mm from the face of the 

separating wall on both sides.

4.45  Piped services (excluding gas pipes) and 

ducts which pass through separating floors in 

conversions should be surrounded with sound 

absorbent material for their full height and enclosed 

in a duct above and below the floor.


4.47  The enclosure should be constructed 

of material having a mass per unit area of at 

least 15kg/m.


Fire stopping should be flexible and also prevent 

rigid contact between the pipe and floor.


Where a gas service is installed, it shall comply 

with relevant codes and standards to ensure  

safe and satisfactory operation.


For internal 

floors, insulation against impact sound could be 

improved by adding a soft covering (e.g.

B2 Field measurement of sound 

insulation of separating walls and 

floors for the purposes of Regulation 

41 and Regulation 20(1) and (5)

Introduction

B2.1  Sound insulation testing for the purposes 

of Regulation 41 of the Building Regulations and 

Regulation 20(1) and (5) of the Approved 

Inspectors Regulations 2010, must be done in 

accordance with: BS EN ISO 1404:1998; BS EN 

ISO 140 7:1998; BS EN ISO 7171:1997; BS EN 

ISO 7172:1997; BS EN 20354:1993.


Airborne sound insulation of a separating wall 

or floor

B2.2  The airborne sound insulation of a separating 

wall or floor should be measured in accordance 

with BS EN ISO 1404:1998.


All measurements and 

calculations should be carried out using onethird 

octave frequency bands.


Performance should be 

rated in terms of the weighted standardised level 

difference, DnT,w, and spectrum adaptation term, 

Ctr, in accordance with BS EN ISO 7171:1997.


B2.4  For the source room measurements, the 

difference between the average sound pressure 

levels in adjacent onethird octave bands should 

be no more than 6dB.


If this condition is not met, 

the source spectrum should be adjusted and the 

source room measurement repeated.


If the condition 

is met, the average sound pressure level in the 

receiving room, and hence a level difference, 

should be determined.


B2.5 

It is essential that all measurements made 

in the source and receiving rooms to determine a 

level difference should be made without moving 

the sound source or changing the output level of 

the sound source, once its spectrum has been 

correctly adjusted (where necessary).


At least two positions should be 

used for the source.


The level differences obtained 

from each source position should be arithmetically 

averaged to determine the level difference, D as 

defined in BS EN ISO 1404:1998.


B2.8  For the source room measurements, the 

difference between the average sound pressure 

levels in adjacent onethird octave bands should 

be no more than 6dB.


If this condition is not met, 

the source spectrum should be adjusted and the 

source room measurement repeated.


Impact sound transmission of a separating floor

B2.9  The impact sound transmission of a 

separating floor should be measured in accordance 

with BS EN ISO 1407:1998.


All measurements 

and calculations should be carried out using 

onethirdoctave frequency bands.


Performance 

should be rated in terms of the weighted 

standardised impact sound pressure level, LnT,w 

in accordance with BS EN ISO 7172:1997.


However, 

for the approved procedure, the guidance in BS 

EN ISO 1407:1998 relating to the source and 

microphone positions, and the number of decay 

measurements required, should be followed.


Room requirements

B2.11  Section 1 gives guidance on the room types 

that should be used for testing.


These rooms 

should have volumes of at least 25m.


If this is 

not possible then the volumes of the rooms used 

for testing should be reported.


Tests between rooms

B2.12  Tests should be conducted in completed but 

unfurnished rooms or available spaces in the case 

of properties sold before fitting out; see Section 1.


B2.13 Impact sound insulation tests should be 

conducted on a floor without a soft covering (e.g.


B2.14 If a soft covering has been installed on any 

other type of floor, it should be taken up.


If that 

is not possible, at least half of the floor should 

be exposed and the tapping machine should be 

placed only on the exposed part of the floor.


B2.15 When measuring airborne sound insulation 

between a pair of rooms of unequal volume, 

the sound source should be in the larger room.


B2.16 Doors and windows should be closed.


Measurement precision

B2.18 Sound pressure levels should be measured 

to 0.1dB precision.


B2.19 Reverberation times should be measured 

to 0.01s precision.


Measurements using a moving microphone

B2.20 At least two positions should be used.


B2.21 For measurements of reverberation time, 

discrete positions should be used rather than a 

moving microphone.


Tests on floor coverings and floating floors

B3.3  Floor coverings and floating floors should be 

tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1408:1998 

and rated in accordance with BS EN ISO 7172:1997.


B3.4 

It should be noted that text has been omitted 

from BS EN ISO 1408:1998.


For the purposes of 

this Approved Document, Section 6.2.1 of BS EN 

ISO 1408:1998 should be disregarded, and 

Section 5.3.3 of BS EN ISO 1407:1998, respectively, 

referred to instead.


B3.5  BS EN ISO 1408:1998 refers to the ISO 

354 (BS EN 20354:1993) method for measuring 

reverberation time, but the guidance in BS EN ISO 

1408:1998 relating to the source and microphone 

positions, and the number of decay measurements 

required, should be followed.


B3.6  When assessing category II test specimens 

(as defined in BS EN ISO 1408:1998) for use with 

separating floor type 2, the performance value 

(DLw) should be achieved when the floating floor 

is both loaded and unloaded.


The loaded 

measurements should use a uniformly distributed 

load of 2025kg/m with at least one weight per 

square metre of the flooring area, as described 

in BS EN ISO 1408:1998.


Dynamic stiffness of resilient layers

B3.7  Dynamic stiffness of resilient layers 

should be measured in accordance with BS EN 

290521:1992.


The test method using sinusoidal 

signals should be used.


No precompression 

should be applied to the test specimens before 

the measurements.


Dynamic stiffness of wall ties

B3.8  Dynamic stiffness of wall ties should be 

measured in accordance with BRE Information 

Paper IP 3/01.


Airborne sound insulation of internal wall 

and floor elements

B3.9  The airborne sound insulation of internal 

wall or floor elements in a laboratory should be 

measured in accordance with BS EN ISO 140

3:1995, and the performance rated in accordance 

with BS EN ISO 7171:1997 to determine the 

weighted sound reduction index, Rw.


Measurements in a flanking laboratory

B3.10 Tests of sound transmission in a flanking 

laboratory include both direct and flanking paths, 

and are a useful means of assessing the likely 

field performance of novel constructions.


Flanking laboratory: indicative airborne sound 

insulation values

B3.13 When a test construction has airborne 

sound insulation of at least 49dB DnT,w  Ctr 

when measured in a flanking laboratory using 

the procedure given in Annex B: B2, this can be 

taken as indicative that the same construction 

(i.e.


identical in all significant details) may achieve 

at least 45dB DnT,w  Ctr when built in the field.


Flanking laboratory: indicative impact sound 

insulation values

B3.14 When a test construction has impact sound 

insulation no more than 58dB LnT,w when measured 

in a flanking laboratory using the procedure given 

in Annex B: B2, this can be taken as indicative that 

the same construction (i.e.


identical in all significant 

details) may achieve no more than 62dB LnT,w 

when built in the field.


It should be noted that the compliance of work 

with a robust detail, in circumstances where the 

correct procedures have been followed to attract 

exemption from PCT, is not a deemed to satisfy 

condition.


In a case 

where building control is being carried out 

by the local authority, the notification must 

be given not later than the date on which 

notice of commencement of construction is 

given under Regulation 16(1) of the Building 

Regulations 2010;
