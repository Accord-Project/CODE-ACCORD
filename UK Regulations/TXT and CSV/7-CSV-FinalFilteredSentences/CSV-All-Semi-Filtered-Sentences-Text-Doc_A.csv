103_UK_DocA_Structure,Loading.
104_UK_DocA_Structure,3.3 Wind loading on the cladding should bederived from BS EN 199114:2005 with its UKNational Annex with due consideration given tolocal increases in wind suction arising fromfunnelling of the wind through gaps betweenbuildings.

112_UK_DocA_Structure,"3.8 The strength of fixings should be derivedfrom tests using materials representative of thematerial into which the fixing is to be anchored,taking account of any inherent weaknesses thatmay affect the strength of the fixing, e.g."

117_UK_DocA_Structure,4.3 Where the work involves a significantchange in the applied loading the structuralintegrity of the roof structure and the supportingstructure should be checked to ensure thatupon completion of the work the building is notless compliant with Requirement A1 than theoriginal building.
118_UK_DocA_Structure,4.4 A significant change in roof loading iswhen the loading upon the roof is increased bymore than 15.
119_UK_DocA_Structure,Where such checking of the existing roofstructure indicates that the construction is unableto sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g.
120_UK_DocA_Structure,"due to overstressed members or unacceptabledeflection leading to ponding), appropriatestrengthening work or replacement of roofingmembers should be undertaken."
121_UK_DocA_Structure,Introduction.
122_UK_DocA_Structure,0.1 The guidance in Section 5 deals with themeans of meeting this performance criterion.
123_UK_DocA_Structure,"Alternatively, check that upon the notionalremoval of each supporting column and eachbeam supporting one or more columns, or anynominal length of loadbearing wall (one at atime in each storey of the building), the buildingremains stable and that the area of floor at anystorey at risk of collapse does not exceed 15 ofthe floor area of that storey or 100m2, whicheveris smaller, and does not extend further than theimmediate adjacent storeys (see Diagram 24)."
124_UK_DocA_Structure,"Where the notional removal of such columnsand lengths of walls would result in an extent ofdamage in excess of the above limit, then suchelements should be designed as a key elementas defined in paragraph 5.3 below."

129_UK_DocA_Structure,"Nominal length of loadbearing wallThe nominal length of loadbearing wallconstruction referred to in 5.1d should be takenas follows: in the case of a reinforced concrete wall, thedistance between lateral supports subject toa maximum length not exceeding 2.25H, in the case of an external masonry wall,or timber or steel stud wall, the lengthmeasured between vertical lateral supports, in the case of an internal masonry wall,or timber or steel stud wall, a length notexceeding 2.25H,where H is the storey height in metres."
130_UK_DocA_Structure,Key elements.
131_UK_DocA_Structure,"A key element, as referred to in paragraph 5.1d,should be capable of sustaining an accidentaldesign loading of 34kN/m2 applied in thehorizontal and vertical directions (in one directionat a time) to the member and any attachedcomponents (e.g."
132_UK_DocA_Structure,cladding etc.)
133_UK_DocA_Structure,having regard tothe ultimate strength of such components andtheir connections.
134_UK_DocA_Structure,Such accidental design loadingshould be assumed to act simultaneously withall other design loadings (i.e.
