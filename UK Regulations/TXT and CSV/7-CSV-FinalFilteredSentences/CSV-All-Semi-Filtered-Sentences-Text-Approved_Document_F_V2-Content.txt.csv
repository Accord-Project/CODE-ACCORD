126_UK_DocF_V2_Ventilation,"How the measurements can help you take actionCO2 measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation within a space, rather than treated as safe thresholds."
127_UK_DocF_V2_Ventilation,A consistent indoor CO2 value of less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well ventilated.
128_UK_DocF_V2_Ventilation,Action should be taken to improve ventilation if CO2 readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.
