1_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"People, regardless of disability, age or gender, should be able to:a. gain access to buildings and to gain access within buildings and use their facilities, both as visitors and as people who live or work in them."
2_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"An extension to a non-domestic building should be treated in the same manner as a new building, as regards its own compliance with Part M. Under Requirement M2 there must be suitable independent access to the extension where reasonably practicable."
3_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,The extensions and the alterations of the existing building could be planned and carried out as a single project.
4_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Under Requirement M3, if sanitary conveniences are provided in any building that is to be extended, reasonable provision must be made within the extension for sanitary conveniences."
5_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"In this case, too, the extension and the modifications to the existing building could be planned and carried out as a single project."
6_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Under regulation 4, where an alteration of a non-domestic building is a material alteration, the work itself must comply, where relevant, with Requirement M1."
7_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"This means that alterations to features relevant to the compliance of a building with Part M, such as entrances or arrangements for people to get from one level to another within the building, must result in features that comply with Requirement M1."
8_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Where new features relevant to the compliance of a building with Part M are provided, these must also comply with Requirement M1."
9_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,Reasonable provision must be made for people to gain access to and to use new or altered sanitary conveniences.
10_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"The building as a whole, including access to it from the site boundary and from on-site car parking where provided, must be no less compliant with Requirement M1 following a material alteration of a building."
11_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Under regulation 6, as amended, where there is a material change of use of the whole of a building to a hotel or boarding house, an institution, a public building or a shop, the building must be upgraded, if necessary, so as to comply with M1 (Access and use)."
12_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"In particular, it should be noted that shop includes use as a restaurant, bar or public house."
13_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Under regulation 6, as amended, if an existing building undergoes a change of use such that part is used as a hotel or boarding house, an institution, a public building or a shop, such work if any shall be carried out as is necessary to ensure that:a. there is reasonable provision for people to gain access to that part from the site boundary and from on-site car parking where provided, either by means of an independent access or by means of a route to and through the building;b. that part itself complies with M1 (access and use); andc. any sanitary conveniences provided in, or in connection with, that part comply with Requirement M1: if users of that part have the use of sanitary conveniences elsewhere in the building, there must be reasonable provision for people to gain access to and use that sanitary accommodation, upgraded if need be."
14_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Where a material change of use results in a building being used in part as a hotel or boarding house, institution, public building or shop, and in part as a dwelling, regard should be had to the guidance in Sections 1 to 5 of this Approved Document in relation to the relevant non-domestic accommodation and to the common parts (see also MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT under Use of Guidance)."
15_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"If Part M applies, reasonable provision should be made:a. so that people, regardless of disability, age or gender, can reach the principal entrance to the building and other entrances described in this Approved Document from the site boundary,from car parking within the site, and from other buildings on the same site (such as a university campus, a school or a hospital);b. so that elements of the building do not constitute a hazard to users, especially people with impaired sight, but rather assist in wayfinding;c. so that people, regardless of disability, age or gender, can have access into, and within, any storey of the building and to the buildings facilities, subject to the usual gender-related conventions regarding sanitary accommodation;d. for suitable accommodation for people in wheelchairs, or people with other disabilities, in audience or spectator seating;e. for aids to communication for people with an impairment of hearing or sight in auditoria, meeting rooms, reception areas, ticket offices and at information points; andf. for sanitary accommodation for the users of the building."
16_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Purpose-built student living accommodation, including that in the form of flats as defined in regulation 2(1), should be treated as hotel/motel accommodation in respect of space requirements and internal facilities (see 4.17 to 4.24)."
17_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,The need to conserve the special characteristics of such historic buildings must be recognised.
18_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"In such work the aim should be to improve accessibility where and to the extent that it is practically possible, always provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the historic building, or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building fabric or fittings."
19_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Particular issues relating to work in historic buildings that warrant sympathetic treatment and where advice from others could therefore be beneficial include:a. restoring the historic character of a building that had been subject to previous inappropriate alteration, e.g."
20_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Whilst alternative, equally satisfactory ways of meeting the requirements can be adopted depending on the size, scale, nature and intended use of the building they must still demonstrate compliance with the relevant functional requirement."
21_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,The key focus should be on ensuring that applicants and building control bodies are agreed as to the appropriate level of provision in the completed building work.
22_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,In smaller or simpler works this could be achieved by having a conversation to review the proposals and recording the outcome of discussions by correspondence.
23_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"It is for the building control body and applicant to agree which, if any of these proposed approaches should be used on a case by case basis to ensure that the functional requirements of Part M of the Building Regulations are satisfied."
24_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Whichever approach is adopted, the agreed level of provision should be clearly recorded."
25_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,It should be noted that approval of proposed works by a building control body does not by necessity indicate compliance with duties under the Equalities Act 2010.
26_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,Applicants need to consider these wider equality obligations when undertaking building work and whether provision in some circumstances should exceed that set out within this Approved Document.
27_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Accessible, with respect to buildings or parts of buildings, means that people, regardless of disability, age or gender, are able to gain access."

29_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Where illuminance on surfaces is greater than 200 lux, a difference in light reflectance value should be a minimum of 20 points."
30_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"For further information, reference should be made to Colour, contrast and perception Design guidance for internal built environments Reading University."
31_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"d. Dwelling, means a house or a flat (flat is defined in regulation 2(1))."
32_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"g. Level, with respect to the surfaces of a level approach, access routes and landings associated with steps, stairs and ramps means predominantly level, but with a maximum gradient along the direction of travel of 1:60.h. Light reflectance value (LRV), the total quantity of visible light reflected by a surface at all wavelengths and directions when illuminated by a light source."
33_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Suitable, with respect to means of access and facilities, means that they are designed for use by people regardless of disability, age or gender, but subject to the usual gender-related conventions regarding sanitary accommodation."
34_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"k. Usable, with respect to buildings or parts of buildings, means that they are convenient for independent use."
35_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"The aim is to provide a suitable means of access for people from the entrance point at the boundary of the site, and from any car parking that is provided on the site, to the building."
36_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"In designing an approach to the building, it should be recognised that changes in level are difficult for many people to negotiate, including wheelchair users, people who need to use walking aids and people with impaired sight."
37_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"The building should be designed, within the overall constraints of space, so that the difference in level between the entrance storey and the site entry point is minimised."
38_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"As far as possible, access should be level from the boundary of the site, and from any car parking designated for disabled people, to the principal entrance and any entrance used exclusively for staff or, if either of these is not accessible, to any alternative accessible entrances."
39_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,The site level of accessible entrances should be determined accordingly.
40_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Generally, gradients within the approach should be as gentle as possible."
41_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Where the gradient of the approach, whether over its whole length or in part, is 1:20 or steeper, that part of the approach should be designed as ramped access."
42_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"All access routes to principal, or alternative accessible, entrances should be surfaced so that people are able to travel along them easily, without excessive effort and without the risk of tripping or falling."
43_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"There should be sufficient space for people to approach the building, pass others who are travelling in the opposite direction and carry out all necessary manoeuvres."
44_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"A level approach (from the boundary of the site and from car parking spaces designated for disabled people to the principal entrance, to a staff entrance or to an alternative accessible entrance) will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:a. it has a surface width of at least 1.5m, with passing places, free of obstructions to a height of 2.1m; b. passing places at least 1.8m wide and at least 2m long are provided within sight of each other (the width of the passing place may be included in the width of the level approach), but in any case spaced at a distance no greater than 50m ; c. the gradient along its length is either no steeper than 1:60 along its whole length, or less steep than 1:20 with level landings (see 1.26(k)) introduced for each 500mm rise of the access (where necessary, between landings), in all cases with a cross-fall gradient no steeper than 1:40; d. its surface is firm , durable and slip resistant , with undulations not exceeding 3mm under a 1m straight edge for formless materials."

46_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"If people need to obtain tickets for pay and display parking, the ticket dispensing machines should be located in a way that allows a person in a wheelchair, or a person of short stature, to gain access close to the machine and reach the payment and ticket dispensing functions."
47_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"People with mobility impairments who arrive as passengers should be able to alight from a vehicle close to the principal entrance, or alternative accessible entrance, of the building in a way that is convenient for entry into the building."
48_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Car parking and setting down will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:a. at least one parking bay designated for disabled people is provided on firm and level ground as close as feasible to the principal entrance of the building; b. the dimensions of the designated parking bays are as shown in Diagram 2 (with a 1200mm accessibility zone between,and a 1200mm safety zone on the vehicular side of, the parking bays , and with a dropped kerb when there is a pedestrian route at the other side of the parking bay); c. the surface of the accessibility zone is firm , durable and slip resistant , with undulations not exceeding 3mm under a 1m straight edge for formless materials."
49_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"If site constraints necessitate an approach of 1:20 or steeper, an approach incorporating ramped access should be provided."
50_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Gradients should be as shallow as practicable, as steep gradients create difficulties for some wheelchair users who lack the strength to propel themselves up a slope or have difficulty in slowing down or stopping when descending."
51_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"A ramped access will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:a. either it is readily apparent or the approach to it is clearly sign-posted; b. the gradient of a ramp flight and its going between landings are in accordance with Table 1 and Diagram 3 ; c. no flight has a going greater than 10m , or a rise of more than 500mm ; d. there is an alternative means of access for wheelchair users , e.g."

53_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,The warning should be placed sufficiently in advance of the hazard to allow time to stop and not be so narrow that it might be missed in a single stride.
54_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,People should be able to appreciate easily where to place their feet by highlighting nosings and avoiding open rises.
55_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,It should be noted that excessive rounding of nosings reduces the effective going.
56_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"A stepped access will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:a. a level landing is provided at the top and bottom of each flight; b. the unobstructed length of each landing is not less than 1200mm ; c. a corduroy hazard warning surface is provided at top and bottom landings of a series of flights to give advance warning of a change in level in accordance with Diagram 4 ; d. where there is side access onto an intermediate landing , a corduroy hazard warning surface 400mm deep is provided either on the intermediate landing 400mm from both upper and lower flights , if there is sufficient space to accommodate the surface outside the line of the side access , or within the side access 400mm from the intermediate landing if there is a continuous handrail opposite the side access ; e. no doors swing across landings; f. it has flights whose surface width between enclosing walls, strings or upstands is not less than 1.2m ; g. there are no single steps; h. the rise of a flight between landings contains no more than 12 risers for a going of less than 350mm and no more than 18 risers for a going of 350mm or greater (see Diagram 5 ); i. all nosings are made apparent by means of a permanently contrasting material 55mm wide on both the tread and the riser ; j. the projection of a step nosing over the tread below is avoided but, if necessary, not more than 25mm (see Diagram 6 ); k. the rise and going of each step is consistent throughout a flight ; l. the rise of each step is between 150mm and 170mm, except adjacent to existing buildings where, due to dimensional constraints, the case for a different rise is agreed with the building control body;m. the going of each step is between 280mm and 425mm;n. rises are not open ; o. there is a continuous handrail on each side of a flight and landings ; p. additional handrails divide the flight into channels not less than 1m wide and not more than 1.8m wide where the overall unobstructed width is more than 1.8m ."
57_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,Handrails should be spaced away from the wall and rigidly supported in a way that avoids impeding finger grip.
58_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Handrails should be set at heights that are convenient for all users of the building and should extend safely beyond the top and bottom of a flight of steps, or a ramp, to give both stability and warning of the presence of a change in level."
59_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Consideration should be given to the provision of a second handrail on stairs in a wide range of building types, and particularly in schools, for use by children and people of short stature."

89_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"If doors are required, the use of self-closing devices should be minimised (particularly in parts of buildings used by the general public) since, as described in 2.14, they disadvantage many people who have limited upper body strength, are pushing prams or are carrying heavy objects."
90_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"Where closing devices are needed for fire control, electrically powered hold-open devices or swing-free closing devices should be used as appropriate."
91_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"The presence of doors, whether open or closed, should be apparent to visually impaired people through the careful choice of colour and material for the door and its surroundings."
92_UK_DocM_V2_AccessAndUseOfBuildings,"For example, when a door is open, people with impaired sight should be able to identify the door opening within the wall, as well as the leading edge of the door."
