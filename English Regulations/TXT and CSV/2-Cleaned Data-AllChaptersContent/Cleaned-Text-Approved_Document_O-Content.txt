Table 0.1  Residential buildings within the scope of this approved documentShared communal rooms and common spaces 

0.4  Shared communal rooms and common spaces of buildings containing more than one residential 

unit fall within the scope of this approved document. 

Live/work units

0.5  A unit that contains both living accommodation and space for commercial purposes (e.g. as a 

workshop or office) should be treated as a residential building, as long as the commercial part can 

revert to residential use. 

0.6  The commercial part of a building can revert to residential use if all of the following apply.

a.  There is direct access between the commercial space and the residential accommodation.

b.  The commercial space and the residential accommodation are within the same thermal 

envelope.

c.  The residential accommodation comprises a substantial proportion of the total area of the unit. 

What constitutes a substantial proportion should be assessed on a casebycase basis by the 

building control body. 

NOTE: A large nonresidential building that contains a small flat for a manager is not treated as a 

residential building. A residential building that contains a room used as an office or utility space is 

still treated as a residential building.

Mixeduse developments 

0.7  The guidance in this approved document applies only to the parts of a mixeduse building that are 

for residential purposes and any corridor that serves residential units.

Alternative approaches

0.8  The guidance in this approved document is the suggested approach to meet the requirements of 

the Building Regulations. Alternative approaches are possible but they should be discussed and 

agreed with a building control body before building work starts.

0.9  The legal requirements of the Building Regulations must be met, regardless of whether the 

guidance in this approved document is followed or alternative measures are taken.

0.10  If alternative ways of mitigating overheating are adopted, the overall level of overheating risk 

reduction should not be lower than the approved document provides. It is the responsibility of 

those undertaking the work to demonstrate compliance. 

Selected key interactions with other parts of the Building 

Regulations

0.11  The approved documents set out what, in ordinary circumstances, may be accepted as one 

way to comply with the Building Regulations. It remains the responsibility of those designing 

or undertaking building work to assess, on a casebycase basis, whether specific circumstances 

require additional or alternative measures to achieve compliance with the regulatory requirements. 

There are interactions between many of the requirements of the Building Regulations and the 

following paragraphs provide guidance on some key interactions.

Approved Document O, 2021 edition 

Building Regulations 2010

Interaction with Part B

0.12  This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on window openings for 

removing excess heat from residential buildings. Approved Document B gives guidance on the size 

of escape windows. Where escape windows are provided to comply with Approved Document B, 

any extra glazing will impact the risk of overheating. 

Interaction with Part F

0.13  This approved document, Approved Document O, includes guidance on providing means of 

removing excess heat from residential buildings. Where openings are used, the amount of 

ventilation for removing excess heat is likely to be higher than the purge ventilation required for 

Part F. The higher amount of ventilation applies  see Section 1 or Section 2 of this approved 

document, depending on the method of compliance.

Interaction with Part J

0.14  Ventilation fans might cause combustion gases to spill from openflued appliances and fill the 

room instead of going up the flue or chimney. This can occur even if the combustion appliance and 

fan are in separate rooms. 

0.15  The guidance in Approved Document J should be followed when installing and testing ventilation 

appliances and combustion appliances must operate safely whether or not fans are running.

Interaction with Part L

0.16  Solar gains in winter can reduce the amount of space heating required to be delivered by the 

heating system. Reducing summer overheating by limiting glazing areas will impact winter solar 

gains and therefore increase the need for space heating. 

0.17  Poorly insulated pipework, particularly in community heating schemes, can be a major contributor 

to overheating. Control of heat losses from pipework is dealt with under Part L of the Building 

Regulations and the guidance in Approved Document L should be followed.

Interaction with Part K and Part M

0.18  Where manual controls are provided, they should be within reasonable reach of the occupants, to 

comply with Approved Documents K and M. 

Interaction with Part K

0.19  This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on increased levels of protection 

from falling from openings compared to Part K. 

Interaction with Part Q

0.20 This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on security considerations when 

providing large openings for removing excess heat. The locking systems of windows and doors 

should also conform to guidance given in Approved Document Q on the security of doors and 

windows in dwellings.

Requirement O1

This section deals with requirement O1 of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.

Limits on application

Requirement

Requirement

O1 Overheating mitigation

 Reasonable provision must be made in respect 

of a dwelling, institution or any other building 

containing one or more rooms for residential 

purposes, other than a room in a hotel 

(residences) to

(a)  limit unwanted solar gains in summer;

(b)   provide an adequate means to remove heat 

from the indoor environment.

In meeting the obligations in paragraph (1)

(a)   account must be taken of the safety of any 

occupant, and their reasonable enjoyment of 

the residence; and

(b)   mechanical cooling may only be used where 

insufficient heat is capable of being removed 

from the indoor environment without it.

Intention

The aim of requirement O1 is to protect the health and welfare of occupants of the building by 

reducing the occurrence of high indoor temperatures.

In the Secretary of States view, requirement O1 is met by designing and constructing the building to 

achieve both of the following.

a.  Limiting unwanted solar gains in summer.

b.  Providing an adequate means of removing excess heat from the indoor environment.

NOTE: The guidance and regulations are written for the purposes of protecting health and welfare. 

Following this guidance does not guarantee the comfort of building occupants.

In the Secretary of States view, compliance with requirement O1 can be demonstrated by using one 

of the following methods.

a.  The simplified method for limiting solar gains and providing a means of removing excess heat, as 

set out in Section 1. 

b.  The dynamic thermal modelling method, as set out in Section 2.

Approved Document O, 2021 edition

O1 

Section 1: Simplified method

1.1  This section details a simplified method for demonstrating compliance with requirement O1. It is 

suitable for any building within the scope of requirement O1. 

NOTE: Appendix B of this approved document includes a compliance checklist. The designer may 

use this checklist to demonstrate compliance to building control bodies. 

Categorising residential buildings (simplified method)

1.2  For the simplified method, the strategy to reduce overheating risk should be selected according 

to the location of the new residential building and whether it has crossventilation, following 

paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5. 

1.3  For the purposes of following the simplified method, the buildings overheating risk category is 

determined by its location in one of the following areas.

Moderate risk location  England, excluding high risk parts of London in (b).

High risk location  urban and some suburban parts of London detailed in Appendix C.

NOTE: Appendix C also provides guidance for some parts of central Manchester.

1.4  For the purposes of following the simplified method, it should be identified whether the 

dwellinghouse or each residential unit, shared communal room and common space is able to have 

crossventilation, i.e. it has openings on opposite faades.

NOTE: Having openings on faades that are not opposite does not meet the approved document 

definition of crossventilation, e.g. in a corner flat.

NOTE: A multioccupancy residential building should not be categorised as having or not having 

crossventilation. Each residential unit, shared communal room and common space should be 

categorised separately.

1.5  The buildings overheating risk category based on location and whether it is crossventilated should 

be used to select the relevant guidance for both of the following purposes.

a.  To limit unwanted solar gains in summer  follow paragraphs 1.6 to 1.9.

b.  To provide an appropriate means of removing excess heat from the indoor environment  follow 

paragraphs 1.10 to 1.13.

Limiting solar gains

1.6  To limit solar gains, all of the following standards should be followed.

a.  The maximum glazing area of the building or part of the building given in Table 1.1 or Table 

1.2. This should be determined using the orientation of the faade that has the largest area of 

glazing. 

b.  The maximum glazing area of the most glazed room given in Table 1.1 or Table 1.2. This should be 

determined using the orientation of the faade that has the largest area of glazing.

c.  Shading for buildings in the high risk location, following paragraph 1.9.

1.12  Openings should be designed to achieve the free areas in paragraphs 1.10 and 1.11. The equivalent 

area of the opening should meet or exceed the free area of the opening. The equivalent area of the 

opening should be assessed by either of the following means.

a.  Measurement of the product to BS EN 131411.

b.  Calculation using Appendix D.

NOTE: A system for purge ventilation should be provided in each habitable room to demonstrate 

compliance with Part F of the Building Regulations. The guidance in Section 1 of Approved 

Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings gives minimum standards for purge ventilation. When following 

this simplified method, applying the guidance in paragraphs 1.10 to 1.12 will usually result in free 

areas that exceed the free areas in Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings.

1.13  The simplified method is not suitable for buildings with more than one residential unit which use a 

communal heating or hot water system with significant amounts of horizontal heating or hot water 

distribution pipework. Main distribution routes should be through vertical risers to minimise heat 

gains into common spaces.

Section 2: Dynamic thermal modelling 

2.1  This section details a dynamic thermal modelling method for demonstrating compliance with 

requirement O1. It provides a standardised approach to predicting overheating risk for residential 

buildings using dynamic thermal modelling as an alternative to the simplified method in Section 1. 

2.2  The methodology is suitable for all residential buildings. It may offer the designer additional design 

flexibility over the solutions in Section 1 in the following situations. 

a.  Residential buildings with very high levels of insulation and airtightness.

b.  Residential buildings with specific site conditions that mean the building is not well represented 

by the two locations in paragraph 1.3, for example Manchester city centre (see Appendix C).

NOTE: Local microclimates may not be well reflected by the geographically closest weather file.

c.  Residential buildings that are highly shaded by neighbouring properties, structures or landscape.

Dynamic thermal modelling method 

2.3  To demonstrate compliance using the dynamic thermal modelling method, all of the following 

guidance should be followed. 

a.  CIBSEs TM59 methodology for predicting overheating risk.

b.  The limits on the use of CIBSEs TM59 methodology set out in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6. 

c.  The acceptable strategies for reducing overheating risk in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.11.

2.4  The building control body should be provided with a report that demonstrates that the residential 

building passes CIBSEs TM59 assessment of overheating. This report should contain the details in 

CIBSEs TM59, section 2.3. 

NOTE: Appendix B of this approved document includes a compliance checklist. The designer may 

use this checklist to demonstrate compliance to the building control body.

Limits on CIBSEs TM59 modelling

2.5  CIBSEs TM59 method requires the modeller to make choices. The dynamic thermal modelling 

method in this section applies limits to these choices, which are detailed in paragraph 2.6. These 

limits should be applied when following the guidance in CIBSEs TM59. 

2.6  All of the following limits on CIBSEs TM59, section 3.3, apply.

a.  When a room is occupied during the day (8am to 11pm), openings should be modelled to do all 

of the following. 

i.  Start to open when the internal temperature exceeds 22C.

ii.  Be fully open when the internal temperature exceeds 26C.

iii.  Start to close when the internal temperature falls below 26C.

iv.  Be fully closed when the internal temperature falls below 22C. 

Approved Document O, 2021 edition 

Building Regulations 2010

O1b.  At night (11pm to 8am), openings should be modelled as fully open if both of the following apply.

i.  The opening is on the first floor or above and not easily accessible.

ii.  The internal temperature exceeds 23C at 11pm. 

c.  When a ground floor or easily accessible room is unoccupied, both of the following apply.

In the day, windows, patio doors and balcony doors should be modelled as open, if this can 

be done securely, following the guidance in paragraph 3.7 below.

ii.  At night, windows, patio doors and balcony doors should be modelled as closed.

d.  An entrance door should be included, which should be shut all the time. 

Acceptable strategies for reducing overheating risk

Limiting solar gains 

2.7  Solar gains in summer should be limited by any of the following means. 

a.  Fixed shading devices, comprising any of the following. 

i.  Shutters.

ii.  External blinds.

iii.  Overhangs.

iv.  Awnings.

b.  Glazing design, involving any of the following solutions.

i.  Size.

ii.  Orientation.

iii.  gvalue.

iv.  Depth of the window reveal.

c.  Building design  for example, the placement of balconies.

d.  Shading provided by adjacent permanent buildings, structures or landscaping.

2.8  Although internal blinds and curtains provide some reduction in solar gains, they should not be 

taken into account when considering whether requirement O1 has been met.

2.9  Foliage, such as tree cover, can provide some reduction in solar gains. However, it should not be 

taken into account when considering whether requirement O1 has been met.

NOTE: Examples of solar shading and their effectiveness are provided in the Building Research 

Establishments BR 364 Solar Shading of Buildings.

Building Regulations 2010  

Approved Document O, 2021 edition 

O1Removing excess heat

2.10  Excess heat should be removed from the residential building by any of the following means. 

a.  Opening windows (the effectiveness of this method is improved by crossventilation).

b.  Ventilation louvres in external walls.

c.  A mechanical ventilation system.

d.  A mechanical cooling system

2.11  The building should be constructed to meet requirement O1 using passive means as far as 

reasonably practicable. It should be demonstrated to the building control body that all practicable 

passive means of limiting unwanted solar gains and removing excess heat have been used first 

before adopting mechanical cooling. Any mechanical cooling (airconditioning) is expected to be 

used only where requirement O1 cannot be met using openings.

NOTE: Any method to reduce overheating risk in residential buildings must comply with all other 

parts of the Building Regulations. Particular attention should be paid to the requirements of Part F 

and the guidance in Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings on noise and maintenance. 

NOTE: A system for purge ventilation should be provided in each habitable room to demonstrate 

compliance with Part F of the Building Regulations. The guidance in Section 1 of Approved 

Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings should be followed for the minimum standards for purge 

ventilation. A larger amount of purge ventilation may be required than that in Approved Document 

F, Volume 1: Dwellings in order to satisfy requirement O1 on providing an adequate means to 

remove excess heat from the indoor environment.

O1 Overheating mitigation

 Reasonable provision must be made in respect 

of a dwelling, institution or any other building 

containing one or more rooms for residential 

purposes, other than a room in a hotel 

(residences) to

(a)  limit unwanted solar gains in summer;

(b)   provide an adequate means to remove heat

(b)   mechanical cooling may only be used where 

insufficient heat is capable of being removed 

from the indoor environment without it. 

Intention 

In the Secretary of States view, requirement O1(2)(a) is met in a new residential building if the 

buildings overheating mitigation strategy for use by occupants takes account of all of the following.

a.  Noise at night  paragraphs 3.2 to 3.4.

b.  Pollution  paragraph 3.5.

c.  Security  paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7.

d.  Protection from falling  paragraphs 3.8 to 3.10.

e.  Protection from entrapment  paragraph 3.11.

Approved Document O, 2021 edition 

O1(2)(a) 

Section 3: Ensuring the overheating mitigation 

strategy is usable

3.1  The standards in this section may mean that the standards of the simplified method cannot be 

met. For example, if external noise is an issue, it is unlikely that windows would be opened by an 

occupant and therefore the minimum free areas of the simplified method cannot be met. In such 

cases, dynamic thermal modelling should be used.

Noise

In locations where external noise may be an issue (for example, where the local planning authority 

considered external noise to be an issue at the planning stage), the overheating mitigation strategy 

should take account of the likelihood that windows will be closed during sleeping hours (11pm to 7am).

3.3  Windows are likely to be closed during sleeping hours if noise within bedrooms exceeds the 

following limits.

a.  40dB LAeq,T, averaged over 8 hours (between 11pm and 7am).

b.  55dB LAFmax, more than 10 times a night (between 11pm and 7am).

3.4  Where insitu noise measurements are used as evidence that these limits are not exceeded, 

measurements should be taken in accordance with the Association of Noise Consultants 

Measurement of Sound Levels in Buildings with the overheating mitigation strategy in use.

NOTE: Guidance on reducing the passage of external noise into buildings can be found in the 

National Model Design Code: Part 2  Guidance Notes (MHCLG, 2021) and the Association of Noise 

Consultants Acoustics, Ventilation and Overheating: Residential Design Guide (2020).

Pollution

3.5  Buildings located near to significant local pollution sources should be designed to minimise  

the intake of external air pollutants. Guidance is given in Section 2 of Approved Document F, 

Volume 1: Dwellings.

Security

3.6  When determining the free area available for ventilation during sleeping hours, only the proportion 

of openings that can be opened securely should be considered to provide useful ventilation. This 

particularly applies in the following locations, where openings may be vulnerable to intrusion by a 

casual or opportunistic burglar.

a.  Ground floor bedrooms.

b.  Easily accessible bedrooms.

3.7  Open windows or doors can be made secure by using any of the following.

a.  Fixed or lockable louvred shutters.

b.  Fixed or lockable window grilles or railings.

12  Approved Document O, 2021 edition 

Building Regulations 2010

O1(2)(a)Protection from falling

3.8  Openings which are intended to be open for long periods to reduce overheating risk might pose a 

higher risk of falls from height. Only the proportion of openings which can be opened with a very 

low risk of occupants falling from height should be considered to form part of the overheating 

mitigation strategy.

3.9  Openings that can be opened wider than 100mm may form part of the overheating mitigation 

strategy where they meet all of the following conditions. 

a.  Window handles on windows that open outwards are not more than 650mm from the inside 

face of the wall when the window is at its maximum openable angle. 

b.  Guarding meets the minimum standards in Table 3.1.

c.  Guarding does not allow children to easily climb it. For example, horizontal bars should generally 

be avoided. 

NOTE: To ensure safe operation it may be necessary to reduce the size of the outward opening 

windows and provide more windows to meet the required free area.

Dynamic thermal modelling A method of building 

modelling that predicts the internal conditions and 

energy demands of a building at short time intervals 

using weather data and building characteristics. 

Easily accessible Defined as one of the following.

 A window or doorway, any part of which is 

within 2m vertically of an accessible level 

surface, such as the ground or basement level, 

or an access boundary.

 A window within 2m vertically of a flat or 

sloping roof (with a pitch of less than 30 

degrees) that is within 3.5m of ground level.

Effective area The area through which air flows 

after the resistance of airflow has been taken into 

account.

Equivalent area A measure of the aerodynamic 

performance of an opening. It is the area of a 

sharpedged circular orifice through which air 

would pass at the same volume flow rate, under an 

identical applied pressure difference, as through 

the opening under consideration. 

Floor area The area of the residential unit, 

measured to the internal face of the perimeter 

walls at each floor level.

NOTE: This area is the gross internal area as 

measured in accordance with the Code of 

Measuring Practice by the Royal Institution of 

Chartered Surveyors (RICS).

Floor area of the room The area of the room, 

measured to the internal face of the perimeter 

walls. Where a room serves more than one activity, 

e.g. openplan kitchen and living room, the area 

with the largest glazing area should be assessed 

and the room area calculated based on a room 

depth no greater than 4.5m from the glazed faade.

Free area The geometric open area of a ventilation 

opening. This area assumes a clear sharpedged 

orifice that would have a coefficient of discharge 

(Cd) of 0.62.

Glazing area The area of transparent material, not 

including the window frame.

Guarding A barrier that denies people access to 

another area, for example the floor below.

Louvre A set of angled slats that allow air or light 

to pass through.

Passive means Any means of cooling a building 

which is not mechanical cooling (e.g. air 

conditioning). Openable windows or mechanical 

ventilation fans are considered to be passive means 

of cooling. 

Purge ventilation Ventilation of rooms or spaces 

at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants 

and/or disperse water vapour. 

Residential units Habitable rooms or a suite of 

habitable rooms. Examples of a residential unit 

include, but are not limited to, a flat or rooms that 

are similar to a flat in care homes or student halls 

of residence.

Shared communal rooms Rooms in buildings 

containing dwellings or residential units, which 

provide facilities for the residents, e.g. a shared 

living room, kitchen or laundry room.

BAppendix C: Areas with a high risk of its 

buildings overheating

C1  This appendix provides a list of the areas deemed to have a high risk of the buildings within them 

overheating. 

C2  This appendix should be used with the simplified method to categorise residential buildings, 

following paragraph 1.3.

C3  The postcodes in Table C1 are in the high risk part of London. Diagram C1 also shows the high risk part 

of London, where a higher standard of risk mitigation is needed.

NOTE: Central Manchester (postcodes M1, M2, M3, M5, M15, M16 and M50) may also have elevated 

night time temperatures. Consider following the guidance for higher risk locations for buildings in 

these postcodes.

Appendix D: Calculating equivalent area

D1  The free areas in Section 1 of this approved document are geometric open areas that assume a clear 

sharpedged orifice with a 0.62 coefficient of discharge (Cd). Different opening types will reduce the 

amount of air flow by both affecting the way air flows and reducing the physical area. Accounting for 

these factors gives the equivalent area.

D2  The equivalent area of a window can be calculated using one of the following.

a.  The discharge coefficient calculator, available online at: https://www.gov.uk/government/

publications/classventandclasscoolschoolventilationdesigntool.

b.  Tables D1 to D9.

NOTE: As stated in paragraph 1.12, measurement of equivalent area to BS EN 131411 is also 

appropriate. Measurement of equivalent area is more accurate than calculation and is therefore 

preferable. 

D3  Using Tables D1 to D9 to calculate equivalent area is appropriate for the following types of window.

a.  Side, top or bottom hung windows. The opening hinge length is referenced as h in the tables 

 Diagram D1 shows this for a side hung window. To use the tables for bottom and top hung 

windows, the h and w should be reversed.

b.  Centre pivot windows. Each of the two sections of the centrally hinged window should be 

assessed as a single side, bottom or top hung window.

c.  Sash windows. The opening should be assessed using Table D9, assuming an opening angle of  

90 degrees.
