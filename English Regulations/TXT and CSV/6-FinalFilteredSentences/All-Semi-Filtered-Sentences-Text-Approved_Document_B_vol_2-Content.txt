In some small buildings/premises, the means of raising the alarm may be simple (for example, a shouted warning).
Fire detection and alarm systems.
1.3  Other than for some small buildings/premises, an electrically operated fire alarm system should be provided.
In some situations, the alarm should be operated by a fire detection system.
The detailed specification should be compatible with the fire strategy for the building.
In residential (institutional) and residential (other) occupancies (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)), automatic fire detection and alarms should be provided.
1.5  Automatic fire detection and alarm systems should be provided in nonresidential occupancies where a fire could break out in an unoccupied part of the premises (e.g.a storage area or a part of the building that is not visited on a regular basis) and prejudice the means of escape from occupied part(s) of the premises.
1.7  Every building design should be assessed individually.
Call points should be installed in accordance with BS 58391.
Design and installation of systems.
1.16  Fire detection and alarm systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained.
A design, installation and commissioning certificate should be provided for fire detection and alarm systems.
Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety.
The interface between systems must be reliable.
Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system.
Where any part of BS 7273 applies to the triggering of other systems, the recommendations of that part of BS 7273 should be followed.
Student accommodation.
1.18 In student residences that are designed and occupied as a block of flats, separate automatic detection should be provided in each selfcontained flat where all of the following apply.
Section 2: Design for horizontal escape.
Introduction.
2.1  Means of escape should be provided from any point on a storey to the storey exit, for all types of building.
No storey has an area more than 280m2.
Escape route design.
Number of escape routes and exits.
2.3  The number of escape routes and exits that should be provided depends on both of the following.
In multistorey buildings, if more than one stair is needed for vertical escape, every part of each storey should have access to more than one stair.
In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts  of storeys used for the residential or assembly and recreation purpose groups (purpose groups 1,  2 and 5).
For places of assembly and bars, no one room in this situation has more than 60 people.
For residential (institutional) buildings (purpose group 2(a)), no one room in this situation has more than 30 people.
A storey with no more than 60 people, where the limits on travel distance in one direction only are satisfied (see Table 2.1).
The travel distance to the nearest storey exit is within the limits for routes where escape is possible in more than one direction (Table 2.1).
The travel distance for the one direction only section of the route does not exceed the limit for travel distance where there is no alternative escape route (Table 2.1).
Angle ABD should be at least 45 degrees.
Distance CBA or CBD (whichever is less)    should be no more than the maximum travel    distance given for alternative escape routes.
c. Distance CB should be no more than the     maximum travel distance where there are no    alternative escape routes.
The direct distance should be assumed to be twothirds of the actual travel distance.
Any solid substance with a flash point less than 120C.
Number of occupants and exits.
2.9  The building design should be based on the number of occupants.
They are in directions less than 45 degrees apart, but separated from each other by fire resisting construction.
Alternative escape routes are available from C because angle ACBis 45 degrees or more and therefore distance CA or CB (whichever is the less) should be no more than the maximum travel distance given for alternative escape routes.
Alternative escape routes are not available from D because angleADB is less than 45 degrees (therefore see Diagram 2.1).
The occupant number of the inner room does not exceed:30 people for residential (institutional) buildings (purpose group 2(a))60 people for other purpose groups.
d.  The escape route from the inner room does not pass through more than one access room.
e.  The travel distance from any point in the inner room to the exits from the access room does not exceed the distances in Table 2.1.f.  The access room meets both of the following conditions.
Planning of exits in a central core.
2.12  Where a central core has more than one exit, storey exits should be remote from one another and no two exits should be approached from the same lift hall, common lobby or undivided corridor (Diagram 2.4).
NOTE: The doors at both ends of the area marked S should be self-closing re doorsets unless the area is subdivided such that any re in that area will not be able to prejudice both sections of corridor at the same time.
If that area is a lift lobby, doors should be provided as shown in Figure 9 in BS 9999.
Access to storey exits.
2.14  Where a storey has more than one escape stair, it should be planned so that it is not necessary to pass through one stair to reach another.
Separation of circulation routes from protected stairways.
2.15  Where they serve protected stairways that are part of primary circulation routes, self-closing fire doors should be fitted with an automatic release mechanism, to avoid them being rendered ineffective by misuse.
A minimum of two escape routes should be provided from each area, except from inner rooms that meet the conditions in paragraph 2.11.
The means of escape from each occupancy should not pass through any other occupancy.
It should be a protected corridor.
A suitable automatic fire detection and alarm system should be installed throughout  the storey.
Widths less than 1050mm should not be interpolated.
Remaining exits need to be wide enough for all occupants, so when using Table 2.3, the largest exit should be discounted.
Stairs should be at least as wide as any storey exit leading onto them.
2.23  If a ground floor storey exit and a stair share a final exit (via a ground floor lobby), then the final exit should be wide enough to evacuate people at a maximum flow rate equal to or greater than from the storey exit and stair combined (Diagram 2.6).
W is the width of final exit in metres.
N is the number of people served by ground floor storey exit.
S is the stair width in metres.
If the number of people (N) entering the lobby from the ground storey is more than 60, then the distance from the foot of the stair or the storey exit to the final exit should be a minimum of 2m (see Diagram 2.6).
If that minimum distance cannot be achieved, the width of the final exit (W) should be at least the width of the stair plus the width of the storey exit.
Required final exit width  ((250/2.5)  (1.2360))/80  2.150m.
Protected corridors.
2.24  A corridor serving as part of the means of escape in any of the following circumstances should be a protected corridor.
Enclosure of corridors that are not protected corridors.
2.25  If a corridor is used for a means of escape but is not a protected corridor, even though the enclosing partitions may have no fire resistance, both of the following should be met to inhibit the spread of smoke.
Openings into rooms from the corridor should be fitted with doors, which do not need to be  fire doorsets.
Division of corridors.
2.26  A corridor providing access to alternative escape routes should be divided by fire doorsets fitted with a selfclosing device (and associated screens) where both of the following apply.
It is more than 12m long.
The fire doorsets (including any screens) should be approximately midway between the two storey exits.
2.27  For buildings other than dwellings (purpose groups 2 to 7): if a cavity exists above the enclosures to a corridor as described above (because the enclosures are not carried to full storey height or the underside of the roof covering at the top storey), the potential for smoke to bypass the enclosure should be restricted by one of the following methods.
Any cavity above this division should be fitted with cavity barriers on the line of division of the storey and the corridor.
Any door that could provide a path for smoke to bypass the division should be fitted with a selfclosing device (but need not necessarily be fire resisting).
The subdivision should be carried to full storeyheight and includes subdivision of thecorridor.
B12.28  Where dead ends of corridors exceeding 4.5m long provide access to a point from which alternative escape routes are available, they should be separated by self-closing fire doorsets (together with any associated screens) from any part of the corridor that either.
Cavity barriers.
2.29  Additional measures to safeguard means of escape from smoke are given in Section 10.
It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.
c.  The part of the roof forming the escape route and its supporting structure, together with any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be fire resisting (minimum REI 30).
d.  The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect from falling.
For other care home types, the most appropriate of either a PHE or simultaneous evacuation strategy should be identified.
The approach adopted in the design of a building must be recorded and communicated to the building management team, who can adopt procedures compatible with the building design.
2.36  Each storey used for the care of residents should be divided by compartment walls into at least three protected areas.
All floors should be compartment floors.
Maximum travel distances within a protected area should be both of the following.
B12.39  The number of residents beds in protected areas should be based on an assessment of both of  the following.
The maximum number of residents beds in one protected area should not exceed 10, but may need to be lower depending on the assessment.
Fire detection and alarm.
2.41  A fire detection and alarm system should be provided to L1 standard in accordance with BS 58391.
Bedrooms.
2.42  Each bedroom in a care home should be enclosed in fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) with fire resisting doors (minimum E 30).
Every corridor serving bedrooms should be a protected corridor (see paragraph 2.24).
2.43  Bedrooms should not contain more than one single or double bed.
Ancillary accommodation2.44  Ancillary accommodation such as all of the following should be enclosed by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).
Door closing devices.
2.45  If doors fitted with a selfclosing device could present an obstacle to residents, the following hardware in accordance with BS EN 1155 is appropriate.
Protected areas may contain more than 10 beds.
c.  Bedrooms may contain more than one bed.
Section 3: Design for vertical escape.
Introduction.
3.1  The limits on horizontal travel escape distances mean most people should be able to independently reach a protected escape route or final exit.
Other effective means to protect common escape routes.
It has no storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level.
The travel distance from every point in each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only.
Every storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level has an alternative means of escape.
A factory comprising no more than either of the following.
For normal risk buildings, one storey above the ground storey, provided the travel distance from every point on each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only.
a.  Refuges should be provided on every storey (except ones consisting only of plant rooms) of each protected stairway providing an exit from that storey.
c.  The number of refuge spaces does not need to equal the number of wheelchair users who may be in the building.
A single refuge may be occupied by more than one person during the evacuation procedure.
It has its own means of escape.
3.6  Refuges should be a minimum of 900mm  1400mm in size and accessible by someone in a wheelchair.
3.7  Refuges should be provided with an emergency voice communication (EVC) system complying with BS 58399.
3.8  Refuges and evacuation lifts should be clearly identified.
In protected lobbies and protected stairways there should be a blue mandatory sign worded Refuge  keep clear in addition to fire safety signs.
It should be at least as wide as any exits giving access to the stairs.
It should be no less than the minimum widths given in Table 3.1.d.  It should not exceed 1400mm in stairs taller than 30m, unless a central handrail is provided.
When a central handrail is provided, the stair width on each side of it should be considered separately when assessing stair capacity.
3.11  Approved Document K requires stairs more than 2000mm wide in public buildings to have a  central handrail.
Section 6 of BS 9999 recommends that firefighting stairs should be at least 1100mm wide.
If the maximum number of people needing to use escape stairs is unknown, calculate it using the floor space factors in Appendix D.Discounting of stairs.
3.14  Regardless of escape strategy, where two or more stairs are provided, it should be assumed  that one might not be available during a fire.
Each stair should be discounted in turn to ensure  the capacity of the remaining stairs is adequate.
Despite these exceptions, at least one storey exit still needs to be discounted (paragraph 2.21).
The following stairs should be designed to allow simultaneous evacuation.
The capacity of stairs that serve more than 10 storeys may be obtained by using linear extrapolation.
The capacity of stairs not less than 1100mm wide may also be obtained by using the formulas in paragraph 3.18.
Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).
Separate calculations should be made for stairs serving basement storeys and stairs serving  upper storeys.
The population, P, should be divided by the number of available stairs.
The population is distributed evenlyThe top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34).
Therefore both stairs should be at least 1070mm wide.
the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 110 people in Table 2.3).
The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34).
Therefore both stairs between the 9th floor landing and the top floor should be at least 460mm wide.
the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 100 people in Table 2.3).
Therefore both stairs between the ninth floor landing and the ground floor should be at least 1200mm wide.
the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 134 people in Table 2.3).
At each storey except a top storey, stairs should be approached through a protected lobby or protected corridor.
At each storey, the lifts should be approached through a protected lobby (see paragraph 5.37).
c.  Every floor should be a compartment floor (REI depending on height and use of the building).
d.  If there is a storey over 30m above ground level, the building should be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.e.  The building should be fitted with an appropriate fire warning system conforming to at least the L3 standard given in BS 58391.f.  An internal speech communication system should provide communication between a control point at fire and rescue service access level and a fire warden on every storey.
The recommendations for phased evacuation provided in BS 58391 should be followed.
Where it is deemed appropriate to install a voice alarm, this should be in accordance with BS 58398.
This table assumes a phased evacuation of the fire floor first followed by evacuation of not more than two floors at a time.
Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).
However, the minimum width of a stair should be 1000mm.
Each remaining stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey.
Thus each stair should be 1000mm wide (maximum capacity 100 people).
the stair widths are not less than the minimum width needed for 90 people in Table 2.3).
Each stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey.
As described in paragraph 3.10a, the stair should be at least as wide as the storey exit serving it.
Design and protection of escape stairs.
Enclosure of escape stairs.
3.23  Every internal escape stair should be a protected stairway (within a fire resisting enclosure).
Construction of escape stairs.
3.24  The flights and landings of escape stairs should be constructed of materials achieving class A2s3, d2 or better in all of the following situations.
If the escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level.
Dimensional constraints on the design of stairs are given in Approved Document K.Single steps.
3.26  Single steps on escape routes should be prominently marked.
If they are intended to serve members of the public, stairs should be type E (public) stairs.
Fixed ladders.
3.28  Fixed ladders should not be provided as a means of escape for members of the public.
External walls adjacent to protected stairways.
3.29  With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the faade, as shown in Diagram 3.3).
3.30  If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm.
External escape stairs.
3.31  Where a storey or part of the building has more than one escape route available, some of the escape routes may be via an external escape stair, provided the following conditions are met.
There is at least one internal escape stair from every part of each storey (excluding plant areas).
Doors to the stair should be fire resisting (minimum E 30) and be fitted with a selfclosing device, except for a single exit door from the building to the top landing of a downwardleading external stair, provided it is the only door onto the landing.
c.  Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) should be provided for any part of the building (including doors) within 1800mm of the escape route from the foot of the stair to a place of safety.
d.  Stairs more than 6m in height should be protected from adverse weather.
Glazing in areas of fire resisting construction should be fixed shut and fire resisting, in terms  of integrity but not insulation (minimum E 30).
Access lobbies and corridors.
3.34  In the following situations, protected lobbies or protected corridors should be provided at all storeys above ground, except the top storey.
If the stair is the only one serving a building or part of a building that has more than one storey above or below the ground storey.
3.35  A protected lobby should be provided between an escape stair and a place of special fire hazard to protect from the ingress of smoke.
Separation of adjoining protected stairways.
3.37  The construction separating two adjacent protected stairways (or exit passageways) leading to different final exits should be imperforate.
The basement storey should be served by a separate escape stair.
It should be single occupancy.
It should not comprise more than a basement storey, ground storey and first storey.
No storey should have a floor area more than 280m2.
Any kitchen or other open cooking arrangements should be at the extremity of any dead end remote from the exits.
c.  For a bar or restaurant, the seating or standing accommodation (Table D1) should be planned for a maximum of 30 people per storey.
For provisions other than those listed above, the guidance elsewhere in this Approved Document should be followed.
Construction.
4.4  Except in kitchens, ancillary offices and stores, floor areas should be undivided so exits are clearly visible from all parts.
4.5  Store rooms should be enclosed with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).
Travel distance and number of escape routes.
4.6  Escape routes should be sited so that the travel distance from any point of a storey to the nearest storey exit does not exceed the distance given in Table 4.1 (see Diagrams 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3).
Storey.
NOTES: If the internal layout of partitions, fittings, etc.
is not known, direct distances, rather than travel distances, should be assessed.
The direct distance should be assumed to be twothirds of the travel distance.
4.8  An open stair may be used as a means of escape if all of the following apply.
4.9  Where the premises contains three storeys and a single open stair serves a top or bottom storey, the stair serving the other storey should be enclosed with fire resisting construction at the ground storey level and discharge to a final exit independent of the ground storey (see Diagram 4.3).
Apart from specific situations described in Sections 1 and 2, and requirements B3 and B5, a minimum performance of REI 30 is sufficient to protect means of escape.
c.  Guidance on the safety of glazing: Approved Document K.Doors on escape routes.
5.6  Doors should be readily openable to avoid undue delay to people escaping.
Guidance on door closing and hold open devices for fire doorsets is set out in Appendix C.Door fastenings.
In general, doors on escape routes (whether or not the doors are fire doorsets) should be either  of the following.
Easy to operate; it should be apparent how to undo the fastening.
Operable without requiring people to manipulate more than one mechanism.
If a secure door is operated by code or combination keypad, swipe or proximity card, biometric data, etc., a security mechanism override should be possible from the side approached by people escaping.
Security mechanism overrides for electrically powered locks should be a Type A call point as described in BS 72734.
The call point should be positioned on the side approached by people escaping.
If the door provides escape in either direction, a call point should be installed on both sides of the door.
In places of assembly and shop and commercial buildings (purpose groups 4 and 5), doors on escape routes from rooms with more than 60 people should be either of the following.
Such locks may be appropriate, but management procedures must emphasise their safe use.

5.11  The door of any doorway or exit should be hung to open in the direction of escape whenever reasonably practicable.
Amount of opening and effect on associated escape routes.
5.12  All doors on escape routes should be hung to meet both of the following conditions.
5.13  Any door opening towards a corridor or a stair should be recessed to prevent its swing encroaching on the effective width.
Ramps and sloping floors.
5.18  A ramp forming part of an escape route should meet the provisions in Approved Document M. Any sloping floor or tier should have a pitch of not more than 35 degrees to the horizontal.
Section 2 of this document refers to Annex D of BS 9999, which gives guidance on the design of means of escape in places with fixed seating.
Final exits.
5.20  The width of a final exit should be at least the same as the minimum required width of the escape route it serves.
5.21  People should be able to rapidly leave the area around the building.
Direct access to a street, passageway, walkway or open space should be available.
Where the route to a final exit does not include stairs, a level threshold and, where necessary, a ramp should be provided.

It should be separate from any circuit provided for another purpose.
Be enclosed with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) when in a position that might prejudice the means of escape.
Care should be taken to maintain the integrity of the smoke reservoir and protect people in the lift.
5.37  In buildings designed for phased evacuation or progressive horizontal evacuation, if the lift well is not within the enclosures of a protected stairway, its entrance should be separated at every storey by a protected lobby (minimum REI 30).
5.38  In basements and enclosed car parks, the lift should be within the enclosure of a protected stairway.
Otherwise, the lift should be approached only via a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).
then the lift should be separated from the high fire risk area(s) by a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).
5.41  Lift machine rooms should be sited over the lift well where possible.
Refuse chutes and storage.
5.42  Refuse storage chambers, refuse chutes and refuse hoppers should be sited and constructed in accordance with BS 5906.
Shop store rooms.
5.46  Fully enclosed walkin store rooms should be separated from retail areas with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) if they negatively affect the means of escape.
(1)   To inhibit the spread of fire within the building, the internal linings shall (a)   adequately resist the spread of flame over their surfaces; and (b)   have, if ignited, either a rate of heat release or a rate of fire growth, which is reasonable in the circumstances.
(2)   In this paragraph internal linings means the materials or products used in lining any partition, wall, ceiling or other internal structure.
It is particularly important in circulation spaces, where linings may offer the main means by which fire spreads and where rapid spread is most likely to prevent occupants from escaping.
Wall-coverings which conform to BS EN 15102, achieving at least class Cs3, d2 and bonded to a class A2s3, d2 substrate, will also be acceptable.

The total area of the rooflights does not exceed 20 of the area of the room.
(1)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that, in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a reasonable period.
(2)   A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings.
(3)   Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent appropriate to the size and intended use of the building, comprising either or both of the following:(a)   subdivision of the building with fireresisting construction;(b)   installation of suitable automatic fire suppression systems.
(4)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.
Measures so that elements common to more than one building or compartment are constructed to the standard of the more onerous of the relevant provisions.
The roof performs the function of a floor, such as for parking vehicles, or as a means  of escape.
In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof  and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by paragraph 7.2a above.
A compartment wall (including a wall common to two buildings): Section 8.b.  Enclosing a place of special fire hazard: Section 8, paragraph 8.7.c.  Protecting a means of escape: Sections 2 to 5.d.

(2)   The roof of the building shall adequately resist the spread of fire over the roof and from one building to another, having regard to the use and position of the building.
Regulation 7  Materials and workmanship.
(1)  Building work shall be carried out(a)  with adequate and proper materials which(i)  are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used,(ii)  are adequately mixed or prepared, and(iii) are applied, used or fixed so as adequately to perform the functions for which they are designed; and(b)  in a workmanlike manner.
(1A)  Building work shall be carried out so that relevant metal composite material does not become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of any building.
(2)   Subject to paragraph (3), building work shall be carried out so that materials which become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of a relevant building are of European Classification A2s1, d0 or A1 (classified in accordance with the reaction to fire classification).

13.15  Roofs with a pitch of more than 70 degrees to the horizontal should be assessed in accordance with this section.
Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included, only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees.
It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of  a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.
(The roof venting could be, for example, PVC rooflights covering some 10 of the floor area and evenly spaced over the floor area.)

If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance of the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not).
If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element should be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions.
The fire resistance of the basement storeys should be that specified for basements.
Fire resisting glass should be marked with the name of the manufacturer and the name of the product.
All fire doorsets should be classified in accordance with BS EN 135012, tested to the relevant European method from the following.
C4  Any test evidence used to verify the fire resistance rating of a doorset or shutter should be checked to ensure both of the following.
C5  All fire doorsets, including to flat entrances and between a dwellinghouse and an integral garage, should be fitted with a selfclosing device, except for all of the following.
A fusible link, but not if the doorset is in an opening provided as a means of escape unless it complies with paragraph C7.
If the opening is provided as a means of escape, both fire doorsets should be self-closing.
C9  Rolling shutters should be capable of manual opening and closing for firefighting purposes (see Section 17).
Rolling shutters across a means of escape should only be released by a heat sensor, such as a fusible link or electric heat detector, in the immediate vicinity of the door.
