The Building Regulations

The following is a high level summary of the Building Regulations relevant to most types of building 

work.
Where there is any doubt you should consult the full text of the regulations, available at  

www.legislation.gov.uk.
Building work

Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations defines building work.
Building work includes:

a.  the erection or extension of a building

b.  the provision or extension of a controlled service or fitting

c.  the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or fitting.
Regulation 4 states that building work should be carried out in such a way that, when work is 

complete:

a.  for new buildings or work on a building that complied with the applicable requirements of the 

Building Regulations: the building complies with the applicable requirements of the Building 

Regulations

b.  for work on an existing building that did not comply with the applicable requirements of the 

Building Regulations:

(ii) 

the work itself must comply with the applicable requirements of the Building Regulations

the building must be no more unsatisfactory in relation to the requirements than before 

the work was carried out.
Material change of use

Regulation 5 defines a material change of use in which a building or part of a building that was 

previously used for one purpose will be used for another.
The Building Regulations set out requirements that must be met before a building can be used for a 

new purpose.
To meet the requirements, the building may need to be upgraded in some way.
Materials and workmanship

In accordance with regulation 7, building work must be carried out in a workmanlike manner using 

adequate and proper materials.
Guidance on materials and workmanship is given in Approved  

Document 7.
Energy efficiency requirements

Part 6 of the Building Regulations imposes additional specific requirements for energy efficiency.
If a building is extended or renovated, the energy efficiency of the existing building or part of it 

may need to be upgraded.

Notification of work

Most building work and material changes of use must be notified to a building control body unless 

one of the following applies.
It is work that will be selfcertified by a registered competent person or certified by a registered 

third party.
b.
It is work exempted from the need to notify by regulation 12(6A) of, or Schedule 4 to, the 

Building Regulations.
Responsibility for compliance

People who are responsible for building work (e.g.
agent, designer, builder or installer) must ensure 

that the work complies with all applicable requirements of the Building Regulations.
The building 

owner may also be responsible for ensuring that work complies with the Building Regulations.
If 

building work does not comply with the Building Regulations, the building owner may be served 

with an enforcement notice.

Guidance on manifestation of glazing

Application

0.2  Regulation 3 defines building work such that the following applies.
a. Glazing which is installed in a location where there was none previously as part of the

erection, extension or material alteration of a building (other than an exempt building), and

the replacement of a whole unit (i.e.
the frame and glazing) is building work and is subject to

requirement K4 and K5.2.
The replacement of glazing whilst retaining an existing frame (e.g.
as a repair) is not building

work, but the supply of the glazing may be subject to consumer protection legislation.
0.3  Requirement K1 applies to means of access outside a building only when the access is part of the 

building (i.e.
attached).
For example, requirement K1 does not apply to steps on land leading to a 

building, but does apply to entrance steps which are part of the building.
0.4  Regarding access routes.
a.
Where access and circulation routes form part of a means of escape for people in case of

fire, refer to Approved Document B: Fire safety, Volume 1  Dwellinghouses, and Volume 2 

Buildings other than dwellinghouses.
b.
For external pedestrian access and circulation routes to buildings, from the boundary of the site

and car parking, reference should also be made to Approved Document M: Access to and use of

buildings.
Interaction with other legislation

0.6  The guidance provided in this document is in relation to the permanent features which form part 

of the building providing reasonable safety in the appropriate circumstances.
However, there may 

well be particular situations, such as access for maintenance required less frequently than once a 

month (e.g.
see paragraph 1.42b), where such permanent features may be less appropriate.
Where

this may be the case the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 provides detail 

on procedures for safe use of temporary means of access, together with focus on effective planning 

and management of risk.
0.7  Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 

may impose requirements on employers and those in control of premises used as workplaces in 

relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace.
Where such regulations apply there 

may be confusion as to whether the Building Regulations or health and safety requirements take 

precedence, as both will apply.
Where an inspector for the purposes of the Health and Safety at 

Work, etc.
Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may 

seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance.
In such circumstances the inspector is 

prevented by virtue of section 23(3) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc.
Act 1974 from requiring 

measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building 

Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more 

onerous.
Where applicable the following crossreferencing should be made.
a.
For building work relating to requirement K1 of the Building Regulations, regarding the design 

of stairs, ladders and ramps, see regulation 17 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) 

Regulations 1992.
Regulation 17 relates to permanent stairs, ladders and ramps on pedestrian 

routes within the workplace premises, including those used to give access for maintenance to 

parts of the workplace premises.
b.
For building work relating to requirement K2 of the Building Regulations, regarding the avoidance 

of risk from falling when working at height, see regulation 6 of the Work at Height Regulations 

2005.

c.  For building work relating to requirement K3 of the Building Regulations, regarding the design 

of vehicle barriers and loading bays, see regulation 17 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and 

Welfare) Regulations 1992.

d.  For building work relating to requirement K4 of the Building Regulations, regarding the 

prevention of personal injury, see regulation 14(1)(a) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and 

Welfare) Regulations 1992.

e.  For building work relating to requirement K5.1 of the Building Regulations, regarding the 

requirements for projecting windows, skylights and ventilators, see regulation 15(2) of the 

Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992.

f.  For building work relating to requirement K5.2 of the Building Regulations, regarding the 

requirements for marking windows, transparent or translucent doors, gates and walls, see 

regulation 14(1)(b) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992.

g.  For building work relating to requirement K5.3 of the Building Regulations, regarding the 

requirements for opening, closing or adjusting windows, skylights and ventilators, see regulation 

15(1) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992.

Stairs, ladders and ramps K1

Requirement K1: Stairs, ladders and ramps

This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the 

Building Regulations 2010.
Requirements

Requirement

Stairs, ladders and ramps 

Limits on application

K1.
Stairs, ladders and ramps shall be so designed, 

constructed and installed as to be safe for people 

moving between different levels in or about the 

building.
Requirement K1 applies only to stairs, ladders and ramps 

which form part of the building.
Performance

In the Secretary of States view, you can meet requirement K1 by ensuring that the steepness, rise 

and going, handrails, headroom, length and width of any stairs, ladders and ramps between levels 

are appropriate to afford reasonable safety to people gaining access to and moving about buildings.
The standard of provision needed to give an acceptable level of safety for access and use depends 

on the circumstances.
a.
The standard of provision may need to be higher in a public building than in a dwelling, because 

people may not be familiar with the building and there may be more users.
b.
A lower standard of provision may be acceptable where access is required only for 

maintenance, because greater care can be expected from the people requiring to gain access.

Stairs and ladders K1

 In a flight of steps, for all steps use the measurements for rise and going given for the three stair 

categories in Table 1.1 below.
Use any rise between the minimum and maximum with any going 

between the minimum and maximum, that complies with the relevant note contained in table 1.1.

Notes:

 1  The maximum pitch for a private stair is 42.
2   For dwellings, for external tapered steps and stairs that are part of the building the going of each step should be 

a minimum of 280mm.
3   For school buildings, the preferred going is 280mm and rise is 150mm.
The normal relationship between the dimensions of the rise and going is: twice the rise plus the going (2R  G) 

equals between 550mm and 700mm.
For existing buildings the dimensional requirements in Table 1.1 should be followed, unless due to dimensional 

constraints it is not possible.
Any alternative proposal should be agreed with the relevant building control body and 

included in an access strategy (refer to Approved Document M).
Stepped gangways in assembly buildings

1.4  The guidance provided in this document covers stairs or ramps that form part of the means of access 

within an assembly building such as a sports stadium, theatre or cinema.
However, if steps are part of 

the gangways to areas for spectators, the gangways may need to be at different pitches to maintain 

sightlines for spectators  this may affect the main stairs.
Apply all of the following guidance.
a.
Ensure that the maximum pitch for gangways to seating areas for spectators is 35.

b.  Align the ends of all rows of seats/wheelchair spaces so that the width of the gangway remains 

the same.
c.  Provide transverse gangways to give access from the side to storey exits (vomitory exits) within 

the body of a seating layout.
d.  Ensure that transverse gangways and radial gangways in auditoria with tiered seating do not 

cross.
Offset the connections between transverse gangways and radial gangways so that the 

flow of people to the exits is smooth.
In stepped tiers, use the following measurements for each step in the gangway:

(i)  minimum height: 100mm

(ii)  maximum height: 190mm

If there are two or more rises to each row of seats, make each step an equal height.
In a tier that is uninterrupted by crossgangways, and where the pitch exceeds 25, use a 

maximum number of steps of 40.

g.  Where an exit is approached from a stepped gangway, place a landing the width of the exit and 

a minimum of 1100mm deep immediately in front of the exit doors.
h.  For stepped side gangways, provide a handrail in accordance with paragraphs 1.34 and 1.36.
In stepped tiers, maintain the same level between the seatway and the nearest step.
j.  Gangways should not be less than 1100mm wide unless used by not more than 50 persons, in 

which case gangways should be a minimum of 900mm.
Construction of steps

For all buildings

1.5  Have level treads on steps, ensuring that the rise and going of each step are consistent throughout 

a flight of steps and are in accordance with Table 1.1.
For buildings other than dwellings

1.6  Use risers that are not open.
NOTE: The benefits of a riser that is not open are as follows.
It removes the possibility of the front of a foot or a walking aid being caught underneath a 

tread during ascent, possibly causing a fall.
b.
It avoids the feeling of insecurity people get when looking through open risers on a stair.
1.7  For steps, apply both of the following guidance.
a.
Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, a minimum of 55mm wide, 

on both the tread and the riser.
b.
Avoid, if possible, step nosings that protrude over the tread below.
If the nosing protrudes, 

ensure that this is by no more than 25mm (see Diagram 1.2).
If the soffit beneath a stair is less than 2m above floor level, protect the area beneath a stair with 

one of the following.
a.
Guarding and low level cane detection.
b.
A barrier giving the same degree of protection.
For dwellings

1.9  Steps may have open risers if they comply with both of the following guidance.
a.
Overlap treads by a minimum of 16mm.
b.  Construct the steps so that a 100mm diameter sphere cannot pass through the open risers.
For common access areas in buildings that contain flats

1.10  Provide a stair with steps that comply with all of the following guidance.
a.
Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, 50mm to 65mm wide on 

the tread and 30mm to 55mm on the riser.
b.
Use a suitable tread nosing profile, as shown in Diagram 1.2. 

c.  Use risers which are not open.

In the Secretary of States view, you can meet requirement K2 if, in order to reduce the risk 

to the safety of people in and around buildings, you use suitable guarding for the appropriate 

circumstance.
Unless otherwise set out elsewhere in this document for particular situations, you can 

achieve this by the following:

in dwellings: provide pedestrian guarding that is capable of preventing people from being injured 

by falling from a height of more than 600mm

b.  in buildings other than dwellings: provide pedestrian guarding that is capable of preventing 

people from falling more than the height of two risers (or 380mm, if not part of a stair).
The standard of provision for guarding needed to give an acceptable level of safety depends on the 

circumstances.
For example, in a public building the standard of provision may need to be higher 

than in a dwelling, because people may be less familiar with the building and there may be more 

users.
For areas where access is required only for maintenance, greater care can be expected from people 

and therefore a lower standard of provision may be acceptable.

Limits on application

Protection against impact with glazing

K4.Glazing, with which people are likely to come into 

contact whilst moving in or about the building shall:

 if broken on impact, break in a way which is unlikely 

to cause injury; or

(b)  resist impact without breaking; or

(c)  be shielded or protected from impact.
Performance

In the Secretary of States view, you can meet requirement K4 if you adopt, in critical locations, one 

of the following approaches.
a.
Measures to limit the risk of cutting and piercing injuries by the use of glazing that is reasonably 

safe, such that, if breakage did occur, any particles would be relatively harmless.
b.
Use of glazing sufficiently robust to ensure that the risk of breakage is low.
c.  Steps are taken to limit the risk of contact with the glazing.
Impacts with glazing, particularly glazing in doors and door side panels, and at low level in walls 

and partitions, can result in cutting and piercing injuries.
For doors and door side panels, the risk is 

greatest for glazing between floor and shoulder level when near to door handles and push plates, 

especially when normal building movement causes doors to stick.
Hands, wrists and arms are particularly vulnerable.
An initial impact at between waist and shoulder 

levels can be followed by a fall through the glazing, resulting in additional injury to the face and 

body.
In walls and partitions, away from doors, the risks relate predominantly to glazing at low level.
At 

that level, children are especially vulnerable.

Manifestation of glazing K5.2

Section 7: Manifestation of glazing

Critical locations

7.1  Critical locations (see paragraph 5.1) include large uninterrupted areas of transparent glazing which 

form, or are part of, the internal or external walls and doors of shops, showrooms, offices, factories, 

public or other nondomestic buildings.
7.2  The risk of collision is greatest when two parts of the building, or the building and its immediate 

surroundings, are at the same level but separated by transparent glazing and people may think they 

can walk from one part to the other.
Permanent methods to indicate glazing, and alternative methods

7.3  People moving in or around a building might not see glazing in critical locations and can collide with 

it.
To avoid this one of the following should be adopted.
a.
Use permanent manifestation to make glazing apparent (see paragraph 7.4).
b.
Use alternative indications of glazing, such as mullions, transoms, door framing or large pull or 

push handles (see Diagram 7.1).
7.4   Provide glass doors and glazed screens (including glazed screens alongside a corridor) with all of the 

following.
a.  Manifestation at two levels, as shown in Diagram 7.2.

b.  Manifestation that will contrast visually with the background seen through the glass, both from 

inside and outside, in all lighting conditions.
c.  Manifestation in the form of a logo or sign, a minimum of 150mm high (repeated if on a glazed 

screen), or a decorative feature such as broken lines or continuous bands, a minimum of 50mm 

high.
d.  Where glazed doors are beside or part of a glazed screen, they are clearly marked with a high

contrast strip at the top and on both sides.
e.  Where glass doors may be held open, they are protected with guarding to prevent people 

colliding with the leading edge.
